        "abstract": "Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\". In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that \"God does not play dice\".Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics. Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z\u00fcrich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, as Jewish, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons. "

        "abstract": "Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist with Swiss and US citizenship. He is considered one of the most important theoretical physicists in the history of science and one of the best-known scientists of the modern era worldwide. His research on the structure of matter, space, and time, as well as on the nature of gravity, significantly changed the previously held Newtonian worldview. Einstein's main work, the theory of relativity, made him world famous. In 1905, his work entitled On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies was published, the contents of which are now known as the Special Theory of Relativity. In 1915 he published the General Theory of Relativity. He also made significant contributions to quantum physics. \"For his services to theoretical physics, especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect,\" he was awarded the Nobel Prize of 1921, which was presented to him in 1922. Contrary to popular belief, his theoretical work played only an indirect role in the construction of the atomic bomb and the development of nuclear energy. Albert Einstein is considered the epitome of a researcher and genius. He also used his extraordinary fame outside the scientific world in his commitment to international understanding, peace and socialism."

        "abstract": "Fritz Haber was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber\u2013Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. It is estimated that two thirds of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber\u2013Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half the world population. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born\u2013Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber is also considered the \"father of chemical warfare\" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I, especially his actions during the Second Battle of Ypres.

        "abstract": "Fritz Jakob Haber, also Fritz Jacob Haber, was a German chemist and Nobel Prize winner for chemistry. He was the founding director for 22 years of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry in Berlin, which is now named after him. His scientific work includes contributions to thermochemistry, organic chemistry, electrochemistry and technical chemistry. Together with Max Born, Haber developed the Born-Haber circular process for the quantitative determination of the lattice energy in crystals. Together with Carl Bosch, he developed the Haber-Bosch process for the catalytic synthesis of ammonia from the elements nitrogen and hydrogen. This enables the mass production of nitrogen fertilizer and thus secures food for a large part of today's world population. He was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this achievement. Haber's experiments with phosgene and chlorine gas shortly after the start of World War I made him the \"father of the gas war.\" Under his leadership, the German gas troops were formed and later poison gas was used for the first time as a weapon of mass destruction. Later, he researched the possibilities of extracting gold from seawater in order to finance German reparations payments after World War I. After the Nazis came to power, Fritz Haber emigrated to England in 1933 because of anti-Semitic reprisals and because of the general political conditions in Germany. He died a few months later in a hotel in Basel, Switzerland."

        "abstract": "Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS  was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes\u2013no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. Following a public campaign in 2009, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way [Turing] was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. The term \"Alan Turing law\" is now used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England \u00a350 note, which was released on 23 June 2021, to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century. "

He is now considered one of the most influential theorists of early computer development and computer science. Turing created a large part of the theoretical foundations for modern information and computer technology. His contributions to theoretical biology also proved to be groundbreaking. The computability model of the Turing machine developed by him forms one of the foundations of theoretical computer science. During World War II, he was instrumental in deciphering German radio messages encrypted with the German Enigma rotor cipher machine. Most of his work remained classified after the end of the war. In 1953, Turing developed one of the first chess programs, the calculations of which he did himself due to a lack of hardware. The Turing Award, the most important award in computer science, and the Turing Test for testing the existence of artificial intelligence are named after him. In March 1952, Turing was sentenced to chemical castration for his homosexuality, which was still prosecuted as a crime at the time. Turing fell ill with depression as a result of the hormone treatment and died by suicide about two years later. In 2009, then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued an official apology on behalf of the government for Turing's \"appalling treatment\" and acknowledged his \"extraordinary services\" during the war; however, a pardon was still denied in 2011 despite a petition. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 2013, Queen Elizabeth II posthumously issued a Royal Pardon."

        "abstract": "Maximilian Karl Emil Weber  was a German sociologist, historian, jurist, and political economist regarded as among the most important theorists of the development of modern Western society. His ideas profoundly influence social theory and research. While Weber did not see himself as a sociologist, he is recognized as one of the fathers of sociology along with Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, and \u00c9mile Durkheim. Unlike Durkheim, Weber did not believe in monocausal explanations, proposing instead that for any outcome there can be multiple causes. Also unlike Durkheim, Weber was a key proponent of methodological anti-positivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive rather than purely empiricist methods, based on a subjective understanding of the meanings that individuals attach to their own actions. Weber's main intellectual concern was in understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and the ensuing sense of \"disenchantment\". He formulated a thesis arguing that such processes are associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity. Weber is also known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the sociology of religion, emphasising the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as driving factors of capitalism. This is in contrast to Marx's historical materialism, which considers religion as derivative of capitalism. Weber first elaborated this theory in his seminal work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), where he included ascetic Protestantism among the major \"elective affinities\" leading to the rise of market-driven capitalism and the rational-legal systems of practice in the Western world. Protestant Ethic was the earliest part in Weber's broader consideration of world religions, as he later examined the religions of China and India, as well as ancient Judaism, with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of social stratification. In another major work, \"Politics as a Vocation\", Weber defined \"the state\" as an entity that successfully claims a \"monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory\". He was the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms: charismatic, traditional, and rational-legal. Weber's analysis of bureaucracy emphasized that modern institutions are increasingly based on rational-legal authority. Weber made a variety of other contributions in economic history, theory, and methodology. His analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the critical theory associated with the Frankfurt School. After the First World War, Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56. "

        "abstract": "Maximilian \"Max\" Carl Emil Weber was a German sociologist and national economist. Although a lawyer by training, he is considered one of the classics of sociology as well as the entire cultural, social, and historical sciences. He taught as a private lecturer and associate professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (1892-1894) and as a full professor at the universities of Freiburg (1894-1896), Heidelberg (1897-1903), Vienna (1918), and Munich (1919-1920). Due to illness, he interrupted his university teaching in Heidelberg for many years, but during this time he developed an extraordinarily productive journalistic activity. In addition, he gathered renowned scientists, politicians and intellectuals for the Sunday jour fixe, whose meetings established the so-called \"myth of Heidelberg\" as an intellectual center. With his theories and conceptualizations, he had a great influence especially on the sociology of economics, rule, law and religion. Even though his work is fragmentary in character, it was nevertheless developed from the unity of a leitmotif: occidental rationalism and the disenchantment of the world it brought about. He assigned a key position in this historical process to modern capitalism as the \"most fateful power of our modern life.\" In his choice of this research focus, a closeness to his antipode Karl Marx became apparent, which also earned him the designation \"the bourgeois Marx.\" Weber's name is associated with the Protestantism-capitalism thesis, the principle of value judgment, the concept of charisma, the state's monopoly on the use of force, and the distinction between ethics of conscience and ethics of responsibility. From his study of the \"redemptive medium of art\" came an erudite treatise on the sociology of music. Politics was not only his field of research, but as a class-conscious citizen and out of liberal conviction he also expressed himself in a committed manner on current political controversies of the Kaiserreich and the Weimar Republic. As an early theorist of bureaucracy, he was crowned one of the founding fathers of organizational sociology via a circuitous route of U.S. reception. Max Weber's wife Marianne Weber was politically active as a women's rights activist, wrote the first and for decades only biography of her husband after his death, and published some of his important works posthumously."
