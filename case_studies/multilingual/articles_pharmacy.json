        "abstract": "Daunorubicin has been established as important cornerstone in ALL- and AML-treatment since many years. Its metabolite daunorubicinol does not contribute to antineoplastic activities of the anthracycline, however, it may have a potential impact on drug\u2019s cardiotoxicity. Current guidelines in Germany consider a daunorubicin dose reduction by 50 % in case of individual GFR between 30 and 50 ml/min which (1) is in contrast to FDA-based guidelines, and (2) which is somewhat confusing when the clinical pharmacokinetic behaviour of daunorubicin and doxorubicin are compared with each other. As a consequence, a leukemia patient may receive daunorubicin full dose in the US, and 50 % of curative dose in Germany in case of e.g. GFR 43 ml/min. Thus, a revised assessment of current guidelines on a regulatory level is of great interest for clinical oncologist."

        "abstract": "The anthracycline daunorubicin has been an integral part of ALL and AML treatment for many years. The metabolite daunorubicinol plays less of a role in the antineoplastic effect, but probably more in the potential cardiotoxicity of the cytostatic. The currently filed guidelines for dose modification stipulate that the anthracycline should only be used at 50% of the usual dose already at a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 50 ml/min and 30 ml/min. This requirement is irritating, considering that (1) the FDA has not provided a corresponding recommendation to date, and (2) recent work has identified very large clinical pharmacokinetic parallels between daunorubicin and doxorubicin. Thus, a leukemia patient with a GFR of 43 ml/min would receive only 50% of the curatively scheduled dose in Germany compared with the United States. A timely regulatory reassessment of this issue is therefore of great clinical oncological interest."

        "abstract": "Vancomycin (VAN) is an established treatment option for infections involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (MRSA). However, the bactericidal effect of VAN on MRSA is reduced in strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of \u2265 1 mg/L. Due to an apparent correlation of VAN MICs with the risk of treatment failure, both EUCAST and CLSI reduced the \u201dsensitive\u201c MIC range to < 2 mg/L. Conversely, the clinical medical societies increased the target ranges of VAN plasma through levels. However, nephrotoxic and ototoxic effects limit the use of increased VAN dosages for the improvement of treatment efficacy. Trough level monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments are recommended for the optimization of VAN exposure. Using the data of 1122 patients from the years 1990 to 2011, we investigated the impact of dose regimens and patient characteristics on the attainment of the newly defined target ranges until day 3 and later in the course of treatment. With dosages recommended by the manufacturers, the mean trough levels remained clearly below the values recommended by current therapeutic guidelines (15\u201320 mg/L for severe infections), particularly in patients without renal impairment. Even with body-weight adjusted dosages, only a minority of patients reached plasma levels that meet the guideline recommendations, particularly during the early phase of treatment until day three. A moderate correlation was observed between VAN trough levels and body weight-adjusted dosage. The intraindividual variability of renal function which is commonly observed in intensive care patients further confounds the predictability of VAN exposure. In most cases, VAN dosages beyond the manufacturer recommendation are required to reach the target trough levels specified by the guidelines (10\u201320 mg/L). These results strongly support early and repeated VAN trough level measurements even in patients with normal renal function. Moreover, the generally low exposure observed in the critical early phase and the limited correlation of dosage and exposure suggest the use of other antibiotics active against MRSA at least in severely ill patients with infections of organs or deep tissues, or if insensitive bacterial strains are involved (VAN MIC \u2265 2 mg/L). Clinical and microbiological responses as well as toxicities were not investigated in this study."

        "abstract": "Vancomycin (VAN) is an established therapeutic option for infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. However, the bactericidal effect of VAN on MRSA is already reduced for strains against which the MIC of VAN increases to \u22651 mg/l. Therefore, because there is a correlation between the MIC and the risk of treatment failure of VAN, EUCAST and CLSI reduced the MIC above which an MRSA strain is considered vancomycin-sensitive to <2 mg/l, and clinical societies increased the target ranges for plasma levels. However, nephro- and ototoxic effects limit VAN dose increases to improve therapy. Valley level measurements after therapy initiation, with dose adjustment if necessary, are recommended to optimize VAN exposure. Using data from 1122 patients from 1990 to 2011, we retrospectively examined the influences of dosing regimens and patient characteristics on the achievability of newly defined target ranges for VAN valley levels by therapy day 3 and later. When dosed according to manufacturer's instructions, mean valley levels were significantly below the current guideline recommendation (15-20 mg/l for severe infections), particularly in renally healthy patients. Even with body-weight-based dosing, only a minority of patients achieved valley levels in line with recommendations, especially by therapy day 3. There was a moderate correlation of valley level with body-weight-based dosing. In ICU patients, more frequent fluctuations in renal function have unpredictable effects on VAN exposure. In most cases, VAN doses above the manufacturer's recommendation are needed to achieve the current valley level target ranges of 10 to 20 mg/l. The results argue for early, repeated valley level measurements even in renally healthy patients. The low exposure in the critical early phase and the limited correlation of dosage and exposure suggest the use of other MRSA-active drugs, at least in critically ill patients with infections of organs or deep tissue areas and in nonsusceptible pathogens (MIC of VAN \u22652 mg/l). However, the clinical and microbiological response and the occurrence of toxicity have not been studied."

        "abstract": "Meropenem, piperacillin and ceftazidime are commonly used broad spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics in intensive care units. To improve the therapeutic outcome of the antimicrobial therapy of critically ill patients therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended. Therefore an analytical method was established measuring fluctuating serum levels during therapy. A simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of these antimicrobial agents. For sample preparation a sample amount of 250 \u00b5l serum was spiked with cefotaxime as an internal standard. Afterwards protein was precipitated using acetonitrile/methanol (1:1). The supernatant was transferred to HPLC. A Merck LiChrospher\u00ae 100 RP-18 (5 \u00b5m) x 125 mm analytical column with a gradient of acetonitrile and a pH 2.2 phosphoric acid solution was used for separation. Peaks of interest were detected via ultraviolet absorbance at 240, 298 and 310 nm respectively. The method developed shows a linear correlation between concentration and response over a concentration range of 2.5 (piperacillin: 6) to 200 \u00b5g/ml for each antibiotic in the serum samples. Validation has demonstrated the method to be accurate and precise too. No interferences with other common drugs except metamizole (dipyrone) and ceftazidime were detected. The method is currently used in the pharmacy department of the German Army Hospital in Berlin for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactams in critically ill patients."

Research topics, in order to counter this threat, include the development of new antibiotics, the reactivation of existing antibacterial agents and the finding of resistance-modifying properties of natural substances. In the present work, the checkerboard microdilution method was used to investigate how the essential oils from cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) and cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) combined with lysozyme amplify the effects of a carbapenem- (imipenem) and an aminoglycoside-antibiotic (gentamicin) against the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results indicate that the essential oils of both plant species reduce the minimum inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and imipenem against multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of the two gram-negative bacterial species and thus significantly increase the antibiotic effects. The observed potent resistance-modifying properties of the essential oils favour further investigations of the phenylpropanoids as the main components of both oils and other natural substances in this context."

CPE has already proved to be effective against several other viruses. At the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), cell cultures treated with Cystus Pandalis\u00ae extract were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the reduction in the infection rate was evaluated by comparing focus-forming units.

The present study aimed to characterize an antiadhesive and anti quorum sensing effect of a characterized A. graveolens extract by specific in vitro assays and to correlate these effects with in vivo data obtained by an animal infection model. Hydroalcoholic extract CSE (EtOH-water, 1:1) from A. graveolens fruits was characterized by UHPLC/+ESI-QTOF-MS and investigated on antiproliferative activity against UPEC (strain NU14) and human T24 bladder cells. Antiadhesive properties of CSE were investigated within two different in vitro adhesion assays. For in vivo studies BALB/c mice were used in an UPEC infection model. The effect of CSE on bacterial load in bladder tissue was monitored within a 4- and 7 days pretreatment (200, 500 mg/kg) of the animals. CSE was dominated by the presence of luteolin-glycosides and related flavones besides furocoumarins. CSE had no cytotoxic effects against UPEC and bladder cells. CSE exerts a dose dependent antiadhesive activity against UPEC strains NU14 and UTI89. CSE inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner bacterial quorum sensing. 4- and 7-day pretreatment of animals with CSE transurethrally infected with UPEC NU14, significantly reduced the bacterial load in bladder tissue. CSE is assessed as an antiadhesive extract for which the traditional use in phytotherapy for UTI is justified."

Patients and methods: In 5 centers, 131 male and female patients from 18\u201385 years were included with posttraumatic or surgical cutaneous lesions with infection or in danger of infection (area \u2265 200 mm2). In a double-blind study, tyrothricin (n = 62; 0.1 g tyrothricin per 100 g of vehicle) or placebo powder (n = 69) was applied to the wound twice daily for 9 days. The primary aim was to evaluate the average daily reduction of the radius from the lesion area between the start and end of the randomized treatment (\u03b1 = 0.025; one-sided). Secondly, a wound index (range 0\u201315) was calculated from the assessments of rubor, crusting, exudation, pain and functional impairment. Results: The treatment groups were comparable at baseline. During randomized treatment, the radius of the lesions was reduced at an average of 0.55 \u00b1 0.31 mm/day (mean \u00b1 SD) for tyrothricin and 0.47 \u00b1 0.30 mm/day for placebo (p = 0.016; one-sided; intention-to-treat data set).
