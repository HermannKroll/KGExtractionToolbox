 "title": "Implementing the comprehensive unit-based safety program model to improve the management of mechanically ventilated patients in Saudi Arabia",
 "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated events are common in mechanically ventilated patients. They are associated with more days on mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and increased risk of mortality. Theoretically, interventions that prevent ventilator-associated events should also reduce associated morbidity. We evaluated the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program approach to improve the care of mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: All mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU between October 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, were prospectively monitored for the development of ventilator-associated events according to the National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. A process care bundle (endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, head-of-bed elevation \u226530\u00b0, target sedation scores, daily spontaneous awakening trials, spontaneous breathing trials), daily delirium assessment, and an early mobility protocol were instituted. The bundle compliance, ventilator-associated events rates, ICU length of stay, and mortality rate were noted. The database allowed viewing of current rates, trends, and averages of all participating sites. RESULTS: In the study period, 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU, and 1,231 required mechanical ventilation (10,342 ventilator days). There were 115 ventilator-associated events: 82 ventilator-associated conditions, 15 infection-related ventilator-associated conditions, and 18 possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The ICU mortality rate was 13.3%, compared with 28.7% for those mechanically ventilated patients with ventilator-associated events (P = .0001). There was increased compliance for spontaneous awakening trials (51.5%-76.9%, P = .0008) and spontaneous breathing trials (54.2%-72.2%, P = .02) and a decrease in infection-related ventilator-associated conditions (4.2-3.5 per 1,000 days), possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.1-1.7 per 1,000 days), ICU mortality (45.3%-19.1%, P = .045), and ventilator-associated events associated mortality rates (33.3%-8.3%, P < .37). Physical therapy participation and mobility were 60.8% and 26.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a multipronged program like the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program could improve the care processes and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients.",

The ICU had 60 beds and was covered by onsite board-certified intensivists 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, with a nurse-to-patient ratio of approximately 1:1 and a respiratory therapist-to-patient ratio of approximately 1:5. The hospital was a 1,000-bed tertiary-care center accredited by the Joint Commission International, with an active Infection Prevention and Control Program that collaborated with the ICU medical and nursing staff to ensure the implementation and monitoring of infection control practices. The Institutional Review Board and King Abdullah International Medical Research Center Ethics Committee of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent."

The implementation of each care process bundle element, along with the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) score and the maximum level of mobility for that day were recorded on a standard data collection form and entered into the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute database, which generated a compliance rate for our hospital. This compliance rate was compared with those of other institutions in the project, so that we could benchmark our performance. If a component of the bundle was not performed, the inspectors used this moment to elucidate any barriers to the implementation of the particular element. The first month (October 2015) was considered the baseline data point."

Ventilator-associated events (VAEs) are the sum of VAC, IVAC, and PVAP. All patients on MV were reviewed prospectively and independently by 2 physicians who confirmed the diagnosis.13 The incidence of VAE, VAC, IVAC, and PVAP was expressed as cases per 1,000 ventilator-days."

   "title": "Project overview ::: MethodS",
   "text": "The project had 3 arms: daily care process, early mobility, and low tidal volume ventilation. Participation could be in 1, 2, or all 3 of the arms (Fig 1\n). Our hospital selected daily care process and early mobility, because low tidal volume ventilation was already a standard practice in our ICUs for all patients on MV.I.Daily Care Processa.\nEndotracheal tube with subglottic suctioning (SUB-G EET)\n\nAll patients anticipated to need MV for >48 hours were intubated with a TaperGuard evacuation oral tracheal tube (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). The data collectors inspected patients for the presence of SUB-G EET when indicated and documented whether the subglottic drainage lumen was connected to the wall suction at the appropriate intermittent negative pressure.12\n\nb.\nHead of bed (HOB) \u226530\u00b0\n\nThe hospital was equipped with Hill-Rom hospital beds (Hill-Rom, Chicago, IL). The angle of the HOB was measured with an electronic device or built-in protractor present on the bed. Elevation of the HOB was the default order for all patients on MV. Exceptions were hypotension; unstable physiological status; low cardiac index; recent cervical, thoracic, or lumbar surgery or instability; ventricular assist device; intra-aortic balloon pump; open abdomen; and patient refusal.12 This element required that the data collector directly observe the angle of the HOB.\nc..\nSpontaneous Awakening Trials (SAT)\n\nA nurse-led sedation vacation protocol was implemented that allowed the nurse to stop all sedation at 8:00 a.m. if the patient fulfilled certain criteria.12 The SAT was continued until either the patient was agitated or fully awake and could be assessed for delirium. For this element, the data collectors asked the bedside nurse whether sedation was interrupted. They then reviewed the patient\u2019s daily flow sheet to confirm the nurse's statement. If the chart did not reflect sedation interruption, then this bundle was considered noncompliant.\nd.\nSedation-minimized (Sedation Score target)\n\nSedation orders were entered via a standardized computer order set, with dosage adjusted based on the patient\u2019s weight and renal and hepatic functions. In addition, a target sedation score (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale [RASS]) had to be assigned to the patient by the physician before the order could be completed. The targeted RASS was addressed daily in rounds, and the nurse\u2019s documentation was examined to determine whether the patient's actual sedation score matched the planned target.\ne.\nSpontaneous Breathing Trials (SBTs)\n\nA ventilator weaning protocol was drafted that allowed respiratory therapists to wean all patients on MV starting at 9:00 a.m., 1 hour after the sedation was held. Patients who met the following criteria were weaned to pressure support ventilation:\n\u2022Awake or off sedation with RASS \u22653 or for >1 hour\u2022Spontaneous inspiratory efforts\u2022Oxygen saturation >88%\u2022FiO2 \u22640.5\u2022PEEP <8 cm H2O\nThe spontaneous breathing trial was conducted by placing the patient on pressure support (5-8 cm H2O) with or without 5 cm H2O PEEP. Both the patient's ICU flow sheet and respiratory therapist's notes were monitored to assess this element.\nf.\nDelirium assessment\n\nThe CAM-ICU advocated by the Society of Critical Care Medicine was used to evaluate for delirium. In our hospital the assessment tool was translated into Arabic, and, after a validation process of several Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, staff were trained to perform this appraisal. The CAM-ICU score was recorded at 10 a.m. daily and documented7:\n\u2022P if the patient is positive for delirium based on CAM-ICU assessment\u2022N if the patient is negative for delirium based on CAM-ICU assessment\u2022UTA if unable to assess (ie, RASS = \u22124 or \u22125)\u2022X if CAM-ICU assessment was not completed\u2022NK if CAM-ICU was completed, but results are not known\u2022NK was also used if it was not known whether the CAM-ICU was performedII.Early Mobilitya.\nMobility\u2014tailor goals to maximize mobility\n\nAll patients admitted to the ICU had standing orders for physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy as part of the admission order sets. The level of mobility (0 to 8) was recorded: 0: passively rolled or exercised; 1: transfer from bed to chair without standing; 2: sitting in bed/exercising in bed; 3: sitting at edge of bed; 4: standing with or without assistance; 5: transfer from bed to chair with standing; 6: marching in place; 7: walking at least 4 steps; and 8: unknown what level of activity occurred. Additionally, any perceived barrier to achieving a higher level of mobility was documented.\n"

   "text": "In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention replaced their VAP surveillance definitions with VAE objective criteria, in response to a series of concerns about the traditional VAP definitions, including their complexity, subjectivity, burden on surveyors, lack of comparability between institutions, narrow focus, and limited association with adverse outcomes.14 Furthermore, VAP did not consistently identify patients at increased risk for poor outcomes, and interventions that reduced VAP rates often had no effect on patient-centered outcomes, such as duration of MV or hospital mortality.15 This is demonstrated in our previous VAP prevention project, in which, in spite of the rate of VAP decreasing from 19.1 to 0 per 1,000 ventilator days, the days on MV remained unchanged, whereas the ICU LOS and ICU and hospital mortality rates all significantly increased in the postbundle implementation group.12 The failure of most VAP prevention strategies to yield better outcomes for ventilated patients raises the question of whether VAP is the best target to drive surveillance and safety prevention programs, because quality improvement initiatives must focus on identifying and preventing objective complications that are unambiguously associated with poor outcomes.15 Thus the explicit intent of the a VAE criteria was to broaden the focus of quality surveillance beyond just pneumonia."

Similarly, Zhu and associates17 in a prospective study of 2,356 MV patients observed that, compared with patients without VAEs, those with VAEs had longer ICU LOSs (by 6.2 days), longer duration on MV (by 7.7 days), and a higher hospital mortality rate (50.0% vs 27.3%). More recently, in a multivariable hazard analysis IVAC was independently associated with a higher hospital mortality rate (hazard ratio 2.42, [95% CI 1.39-4.20], P = .002).18 Our data also demonstrated that VAEs are associated with increased mechanical ventilator days, ICU LOS, and ICU mortality, highlighting the point that a VAE appears to be a clinically important event."

   "text": "The synthesis of the VAE criteria has created a new opportunity for health care facilities to reexamine their approach to preventing complications and improving outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients. VAE surveillance has a quality metric character and appears to identify potential safety opportunities to improve care and outcomes for patients.19 Theoretically, interventions most likely to prevent VAEs are those that help patients avoid intubation, minimize the duration of MV, or prevent the conditions that most commonly trigger a VAE (pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis).20 Use of high-flow nasal oxygen for hypoxemic and noninvasive ventilation for hypercapnic respiratory failure may avoid intubation. Minimizing sedation, performing daily coordinated SATs and SBTs, and perhaps early mobility are strategies to decrease the duration of MV. Strategies to prevent pneumonia, volume overload, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and atelectasis include HOB elevation, conservative fluid management, conservative blood transfusion thresholds, low tidal volume ventilation, and early mobility.14 These interventions are consistent with the best care practices advocated by the ABCDEF bundle, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America's recommendations to prevent VAP.21, 22, 23 Growing data support that implementing and optimizing these practices can lower VAE rates and improve patient outcomes. The CUSP 4MVP-VAP project was engendered to continue this wider focus of implementing an evidence-based practice bundle while caring for MV patients."

This is similar to data published from 56 ICUs in Maryland and Pennsylvania with 69,417 ventilated patient-days in which compliance with SAT and SBT was 77.5% and 71%, respectively.24 Our ICUs have a nurse-led sedation vacation protocol and target sedation scores for all sedated patients. Furthermore, we have an SBT protocol that is respiratory therapist driven. Our low compliance rates could highlight the difficulty of translating evidence-based practice to bedside, or they may represent a defect in our protocol design preventing meaningful change in the practice behavior and culture of our front-line staff."

   "text": "Our data demonstrated that 1.8% of mechanically ventilated patients were mobilized into a chair, and only 60.1% were evaluated by a physical therapist while receiving MV. Early and progressive mobilization has been demonstrated to be both safe and feasible for patients admitted to critical care.25 Implementing early mobility programs has led to improvements in physical function and mobility levels, significant reductions in both ICU and hospital LOS, and ventilation days and a reduction in both the incidence and duration of delirium.26 In fact, the ABCDE bundle is centered on approaches to implement the Integrated pain, agitation, and delirium clinical practice guidelines to reduce delirium and weakness related to oversedation, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and immobility in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.27 Despite this, point prevalence surveys have shown that rehabilitation levels remain low. Goddard and colleagues,28 using a Theoretical Domains Framework of behavior change, found that the social influences domain (local champions, ICU leadership, discord between team members and family members) and behavioral regulation domain (feedback and having a unit protocol) may act as barriers or facilitators to early rehabilitation. Based on these findings, we formulated a multidisciplinary team and a mobility protocol to provide tools to standardize the care of our patients (Appendix 1)."

   "text": "The strengths of our study include the use of prospective collected data, a large sample size with all patients observed daily until ICU discharge, and a common surveillance system using standardized definitions with a Web-based portal for real-time reports. Despite its strengths, our study has several potential limitations. First, a reduction in VAE rates might be beyond the effect of just implementing the bundle, because the VAE rates might have decreased secondary to other simultaneous infection control projects in our ICUs. Second, this was not a preintervention and postintervention study, so analyzing the full effect of the bundle is difficult. Third, despite having standardized data collection techniques and sources, team members might be motivated to demonstrate improvement and potentially could bias results. Fourth, we report VAE rates per 1,000 ventilator days, and any intervention that decreases ventilator days may paradoxically increase VAE rates and underestimate the impact of the intervention on VAE outcomes. Fifth, ICU LOS may depend on multiple complex factors and not only VAEs. Finally, the data represent a cohort study from a single center, and our inventions might not be generalized to other institutions."

A strategic framework for preventing VAEs is to pair clinical bundle with practice behavior and culture change interventions.
