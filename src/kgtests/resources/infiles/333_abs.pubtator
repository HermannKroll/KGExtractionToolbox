23|t|Effect of etafenone on total and regional myocardial blood flow.
23|a|The distribution of blood flow to the subendocardial, medium and subepicardial layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under normoxic (A), hypoxic (B) conditions and under pharmacologically induced (etafenone) coronary vasodilation (C). Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism.

33|t|Effect of human erythrocyte stromata on complement activation.
33|a|Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum test. The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities. Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation. When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.

53|t|The interaction of phospholipase A2 with micellar interfaces. The role of the N-terminal region.
53|a|The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) in porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic hydrolysis. Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion. At alkaline pH, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions.

54|t|Phospholipase A2 as a probe of phospholipid distribution in erythrocyte membranes. Factors influencing the apparent specificity of the reaction.
54|a|The action of snake venom phospholipases A2 in intact human erythrocytes was investigated in detail. The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the cell when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied. Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis. It is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution. Certain facets of this problem are discussed.

69|t|Purification and some enzymatic properties of the chitosanase from Bacillus R-4 which lyses Rhizopus cell walls.
69|a|A strain of Bacillus sp (Bacillus R-4) produces a protease and a carbohydrolase both of which have the ability to lyse Rhizopus cell walls. Of the enzymes, the carbohydrolase has been purified to an ultracentrifugally and electrophoretically homogeneous state, and identified as a chitosanase. The enzyme was active on glycol chitosan as well as chitosan. Molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated as 31 000 and isoelectric point as pH 8.30. The enzyme was most active at pH 5.6 and at 40 degrees C with either Rhizopus cell wall or glycol chitosan as substrate, and was stable over a range of pH 4.5 to 7.5 at 40 degrees C for 3 h. The activity was lost by sulfhydryl reagents and restored by either reduced glutathione of L-cysteine. An abrupt decrease in viscosity of the reaction mixture suggested an endowise cleavage of chitosan by this enzyme.

73|t|Radioactive labeling and location of specific thiol groups in myosin from fast, slow and cardiac muscles.
73|a|1. Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types. All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities.

75|t|Characteristics of the dephosphorylated form of phosphorylase purified from rat liver and measurement of its activity in crude liver preparations.
75|a|The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan : orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of AMP. We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes.

149|t|Some characteristics of two azoreductase systems in rat liver. Relevance to the activity of 2-[4'-di(2"-bromopropyl)-aminophenylazo]benzoic acid (CB10-252), a compound possessing latent cytotoxic activity.
149|a|The system involved in the reduction of 2-[4'-di(2''-bromopropyl) aminophenylazolbenzoic acid (CB10-252), an agent designed for treating primary liver cell cancer, has been demonstrated to be localised mainly in the 108 000 X g supernatant fraction of rat liver homogenate. It is also present in other organs particularly in the spleen. DAB-azoreductase as shown previously is present almost entirely in the microsomal fraction and is found in high concentration only in liver. The pH maximum for CB10-252-azoreductase implying the importance of the 2'-carboxyl group in determining substrate specificity. The use of enzyme inhibitors and other additives showed that CB10-252 WAS NOT AXANTHINE OXIDASE OR DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE. Its activity was not affected by carbon monoxide, phenobarbitone (PB), or 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) pretreatment. Enhancement of the activity by ferrous ions and FAD indicated that at least part of the reduction system could involve a flavoprotein with FAD as the prosthetic group. The activity of CB10-252-azoreductase and methylred-azoreductase was reduced by menadione (vitamin K3), cyanide and propylgallate. A diaphorase preparation from pig heart reduced both CB10-252 and methylred with both NADPH- and NADH-generating systems.

151|t|[Basic phospholipase of Naja nigricollis venom].
151|a|It is confirmed that N. nigricollis venom contains several phospholipases one of these is a basic phospholipase A. This enzyme is toxic for mice when injected intravenously. In vitro it reacts on egg yolk lecithin producing lysolecithin and prevents the phenomenon of blood clotting. An immunological identity has been established between this basic phospholipase and two acidic phospholipases present in the same venom.

171|t|Arterial catecholamines in hypoxic exercise in man.
171|a|1. We measured the minute ventilation and arterial blood catecholamine concentrations in four normal men standing and at two levels of moderate treadmill exercise breathing 14% oxygen or air. 2. Minute ventilation was significantly higher during hypoxic exercise than during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min. 3. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during hypoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was significantly greater than at rest. 4. Arterial plasma noradrenaline during normoxic exercise at an oxygen uptake of 1500 ml/min was not elevated above the resting concentration. 5. The results are compatible with the suggestion that increased concentrations of arterial plasma noradrenaline contribute to the hypoxic potentiation of the respiratory response to moderate exercise.

270|t|Chromosomal basis of the merozygosity in a partially deploid mutant of Pneumococcus.
270|a|A sulfonamide-resistant mutant of pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays a genetic instability, regularly segregating to wild type. DNA extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming activities for both the mutant and wild-type alleles, establishing that the strain is a partial diploid. The linkage of sulr-c to strr-61, a stable chromosomal marker, was established, thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulr-c. DNA isolated from sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type recipient, although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating classical "low-efficiency" donor markers equally as efficiently as "high efficiency" markers. Hence sulr-c must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations. We suggest that the DNA in the region of the sulr-c mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation.

278|t|[Biphasic (ulcer-forming and ulcer-preventing) effect of adrenaline in rats].
278|a|Adrenaline-induced gastric ulceration was studied in rats. Adrenaline in high doses caused gastric ulcer, which was completely blocked by pretreatment with alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine), but not by pretreatment with propranolol or atropine, nor by vagotomy, hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. After successive administration of adrenaline, once daily for 7 days, however, no gastric ulcer was observed. Recovery from the ulcerogenic action of adrenaline was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal. Pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline inhibited the ulcerogenic action of a high dose of adrenaline. Pretreatment with reserpine, pyrogallol or iproniazid inhibited the action of adrenaline. It is concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration, the ulcerogenic action is due to its alpha-action and antiulcerogenic effect is due to development of tachyphylaxis.

296|t|Limited hydrolysis of tRNA by phosphodiesterase.
296|a|Digestion of tRNA by electrophoretically pure phosphodiesterase is limited to a short sequence of nucleotides at the 3'-terminus. On the average, four percent of all nucleotides can be released from tRNA. The optimum Mg2 concentration is 10mM and the optimum pH 9.2. The mode of action is a random attack by the enzyme on the substrate. The terminal AMP is completely removed at 15 degrees C after short incubation; about 400 mol of AMP were removed per min by 1 mol of enzyme. The following CMP residues are released much more slowly; at 15 degrees C incompletely, and at 37 degrees C more or less completely in 1 h. In about 50% of the tRNA molecules, the fourth nucleotide could be removed in very long incubations or with very high enzyme concentrations.

337|t|Tyrosine aminotransferase induction in normal and tumor-bearing chickens.
337|a|Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) induction by glucagon and dexamethasone in the liver of tumor-bearing chickens was studied and compared with induction in healthy animals. The transplantable tumor was caused by inoculation of cells from a cell line induced by MC29 avian leukosis virus. TAT was hardly detectable in tumor tissue of control and dexamethasone-treated chickens, but it was induced by glucagon to levels which were significant although very low when compared to those in host liver or the liver of non-tumor-bearing controls after glucagon treatment. Dexamethasone failed to induce TAT in host liver at 8 A.M. while it significantly indiced TAT in the normal liver at the same time of the day. Similar failure of TAT induction was not detectable when glucagon was used instead of dexamethasone. Furthermore, it was found that diurnal variations in basal and dexamethasone or glucagon-induced TAT levels are considerably mitigated in host liver as compared to those observed in the liver of healthy animals. The possible reasons for these findings are discussed.

339|t|A kinetic study of the hydrolysis of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester.
339|a|Hydrolysis rates of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester (methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate) and related model compounds were measured in aqueous, organic and mixed aqueous media. Adding dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to water, retarded hydrolysis of the ester by a factor of 2 to 500, depending on the pH of the medium and concentration of DMSO. Ethanol also slowed hydrolysis, but the effect was not so pronounced. Related studies show that the acetamido group C-N bond of sodium 2-acetamido-acrylate is hydrolyzed only about 1/130 as fast as the ester group C-O bond. Aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide should by a useful medium for synthesis of peptide, amino acid and protein derivatives of N-acetyl dehydroalanine methyl ester.

358|t|Formation and cleavage of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase of Aspergillus niger.
358|a|2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase of Aspergillus niger, an enzyme that has not been reported previously, was purified 468-fold. Maximal activity was obtained at pH 8.0 and 50 C. The enzyme exhibited relative stereochemical specificity with respect to glyceraldehyde. The Km values for 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, glyceraldehyde, and pyruvate were 10, 13.3, and 3.0 mM, respectively. The effects of some compounds and inhibitors on enzyme activity were examined. Stability of the enzyme under different conditions was investigated. The equilibrium constant was about 0.33 X 10(-3) M.

393|t|Hemoglobin Deer Lodge (beta 2 His replaced by Arg). Consequences of altering the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site.
393|a|Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. When stripped of anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced. This contrasts with the enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates. Due to enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A. The fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase. The two phases are not resolvable at high pH. CO combination kinetics are much like those of Hb A except that "fast" and "slow" phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest that functional differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A. This may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more strongly than Hb A. The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

397|t|Nucleotide-metabolizing enzymes in Chlamydomonas flagella.
397|a|Nucleotides have at least two functions in eukaryotic cilia and flagella. ATP, originating in the cells, is utilized for motility by energy-transducing protein(s) called dynein, and the binding of guanine nucleotides to tubulin, and probably certain transformations of the bound nucleotides, are prerequisites for the assembly of microtubules. Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies. Since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization. Arginine kinase was not detected in Chlamydomonas flagellar extracts.

402|t|Leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens). Effect of pH on the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ to and on activation of the enzyme.
402|a|Incubation of leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) with various concentrations of Mg2+ at various pH values in 1 M KCl and 0.155 M trimethylamine-HCl at 37 degrees confirms that Mg2+ competes with Zn2+ for binding only 1 site per 54,000-dalton subunit. The ratio of the apparent association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) at this site (site 1) was estimated to be 20,720 at pH 8.16, 10,570 at pH 8.44, 3,590 at pH 8.78, and 660 AT PH 9.14. The decrease in values of 1KZn/Mg with increasing pH in the activation of leucine aminopeptidase by Mg2+ is attributed to the lowering of the free Zn2+ concentration relative to that of free Mg2+ caused by the formation of ZnOH+ and Zn(OH)2 complexes with increasing OH- concentration. When corrections are made for the binding of Zn2+ by OH- ions, the pH-independent ratio of association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) for the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at site 1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800. From the effect of pH on the relative binding constant, a value (beta2) for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn2+ and OH- (Zn2+ + OH- in equilibrium ZnOH+; ZnOH+ + OH- in equilibrium Zn(OH)2) was estimated to be 4.42 X 10(10) M-2 at 37 degrees. Values of Km at pH 7.5 AND 30 degrees with L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in the presence of 0.01 M NaHCO3 are 4.13 and 2.01 mM for the zinc-zinc and magnesium-zinc enzymes, respectively. Values for Vmax are 0.2 and 2.49 mumol/min/mg, respectively.

406|t|Structure, composition, physical properties, and turnover of proliferated peroxisomes. A study of the trophic effects of Su-13437 on rat liver
406|a|Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active.

408|t|Defective lysosomal enzyme secretion in kidneys of Chediak-Higashi (beige) mice
408|a|The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types. In mice, treatment with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. Beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney beta- glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice. Other androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice. No significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen. Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary. In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine. Levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice. It appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane. A similar defect could account for characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

448|t|The innervation of the salivary gland of the moth, Manduca sexta: evidence that dopamine is the transmitter.
448|a|1. Using the Falck-Hillarp histochemical technique for monoamines, evidence was found for the presence of a catecholamine in the salivary gland nerves of the moth, Manduca sexta. 2. The innervation was studied with the electron microscope. Only the fluid-secreting region of the gland is innervated and the nerve endings are characteristic of monoamine-containing terminals. 3. Using a sensitive enzymatic-isotopic assay for catecholamines, it was found that whole salivary glands contain 0.33 mug/g dopamine but no noradrenaline. 4. It seems likely that dopamine mediates fluid-secretion in the salivary gland of Manduca as it does a number of other arthropods.

459|t|Some effects of low pH on chloride exchange in human red blood cells
459|a|In order to test the range of pH values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid, chloride self- exchange across human red blood cells was examined between pH 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c. It was found that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity. The Arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values. The chloride flux at pH 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared. In addition, the extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low pH. Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below pH5. A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values.

492|t|The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.
492|a|1. The experiments were done on single nodes of Ranvier of Rana esculenta. The effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was determined to be 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in A. The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5). In more acid toxin solutions A decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free solution. 5. When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as measured 1 sec after the switch. Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T. 7. Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH. Moreover, p'T was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration. This suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and H ions compete for the same blocking site. A quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions.

507|t|Negative potential level in the outer layer of the toad skin.
507|a|The isolated skin of the toad Bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement. The superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin, displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum. Null value is obtained at 19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements. Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum. PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration. Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had only minor effects on PDi. Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi. At pH 3 PDi was positive. PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum. Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum, with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution. Skin potential, short-circuit current and their relationship to PDI were discussed.

542|t|[Validity of pH measurements by means of micro pH combination electrodes in blood and other biological fluids (author's transl)].
542|a|pH measurements in blood or in media containing either proteins or polypeptides and performed by means of micro pH combination electrodes type N 58 (Schott & Gen., Mainz) yield in a systematic error according to the regression line y = 1.135 chi - 0.842, in the range between pH 5.3 and 8.3. This deviation from the real pH value is independent of the protein concentration and amounts to 0.1-0.2 pH units in the physiological range. The error does not occur if the pH measurements are performed in media which are free of proteins and polypeptides, respectively. If the electrolyte solution within the reference electrode is replaced (NaCl solution instead of KCl solution) the error is distinctly reduced. For this reason, this deviation should be caused by the variation of the diffusion potential across the platinum junctions.

627|t|Relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in the rabbit pulmonary artery.
627|a|The rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which meidate smooth muscle contraction; its noradrenergic nerves contain presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses. Dose-response curves for the pre- and postsynaptic effects of eight alpha-receptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine, corticosterone and propranolo. 1. According to the concentrations which caused 20% of the maximal contraction (EC20 post), the postsynaptic rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine. The pA2 values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline, phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were 7.43, 7.48, 7.59 and 7.69, respectively. 2. For the investigation of presynaptic effects, the arteries were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline. All agonists inhibited the overflow of tritium evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation. According to the concentrations which reduced the stimulation-induced overflow by 20% (EC20 pre), the rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. 10(-5) M phentolamine shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the right. 3. The ratio EC20 pre/EC20 post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post- and presynaptic potency. According to the ratios, the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups. Group 1 (ratio about 30: preferentially postsynaptic agonists) comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine; group 2 (ratio near 1; similar pre- and postsynaptic potencies) comprised noradrenaline, adrenaline and naphazoline; group 3 (ratio below 0.2; preferentially presynaptic agonists) comprised oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline (as well as clonidine). 4. Preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation. Methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced, but never reduced, the response. In contrast, oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency (0.25-2Hz). 5. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies, possibly because of structural differences between pre- and postsynaptic alpha-receptors. Pre- and postsynaptic components contribute to their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses. The preferential activation of presynaptic alpha-receptors results in alpha-adrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission.

628|t|Investigation into some imidazoline compounds, with respect to peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and depression of cardiovascular centers.
628|a|Peripheral alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation was tested by means of hypertensive effects of the drugs following i.v. injection in spinal rats. Naphazoline (NP), oxymetazoline (OM), St 91-2-(2,6-diethylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and St 1697--2-(2-ethyl, 6-methylphenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--were 3 to 5 times more potent in tthis respect thatn clonidine (CLON) whereas St 363--2-(2,4-dichlorophenylimino)-2-imidazolidine--and xylazine (XY) exerted only approx. 1/20 the effect of that of clonidine. Sympathoinhibitory activity after i.v. injection was tested by the bradycardiac effect in vagotomized rats; St 1697, St 363 and XY were active, approx. 1/10-1/30 of CLON, whereas NP, OM and St 91 were inactive. However, following intracisternal (i.ci.) injection of cardiovascular depression, typical for clonidine: (1) in dogs with blocked beta-adrenoceptors, the drugs facilitated the vagally meditated cardiodepressor reflex in response to baroreceptor stimulation by i.v. injection of angiotensin; (2) in dogs treated with atropine and in (3) vagotomized cats (only NP, OM and St 363) a long lasting decrease in heart rate was observed. Some of the experiments were complicated by increases in blood pressure, due to the "leakage" of small amounts of the highly vasopressor active drugs, from the cisternal spaces into the peripheral circulation. The majority of results indicated, that the central cardiovascular depressor effects of the tested drugs depend on their alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulating potency and on their ability to penetrate from cerebrospinal fluid or from the blood to cardiovascular centers. Relationships between the ability for penetration and the lipoid affinity are discussed.

671|t|Intramolecular arsanilazotyrosine-248-Zn complex of carboxypeptidase A: a monitor of catalytic events.
671|a|The intensely chromophoric intramolecular coordination complex formed between arsanilazotyrosine-248 and the active site zinc atom of azocarboxypeptidase A (Johansen, J. T. & Vallee, B. L. (1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68, 2532-2535) is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events. The interconversion of the azoTyr-248-Zn complex and its constituents is measured by stopped-flow pH and temperature-jump methods. The rate of interconversion, 64,000 sec-1, is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself (about 0.01-100 sec-1). Rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azoTyr-248-Zn complex before hydrolysis occurs. As a consequence, formation of azoTyr-248, substrate binding, and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress. The results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events, different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis. If azoTyr-248 is displaced, the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates, since rapid changes in pH also result in analogous spectral changes. AzoTyr-248 carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies: (1) It is enzymatically active; (2) the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents; (3) it responds dynamically to environmental factors; and (4) the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step. These combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process.

675|t|Identification of NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system in Euglena gracillis.
675|a|Euglena gracilis contains a protein system which can utilize the reducing power of NADPH in the ribonucleotide reductase-catalyzed reduction of CTP. The proteins required for this reaction are a flavoprotien with a molecular weight of approximately 185,000 which is functionally similar to thioredoxin reductase (NADPH), EC 1.6.4.5, and another protein (Protein I) whose function in the reaction is unknown. This new protein does not appear to contain a prosthetic group and has a molecular weight of approximately 240,000. In addition, the ribonucleotide reductase active in the Euglena NADPH-thioredoxin reductase system is more complex than the protein reported in a previous publication [(1974) j. Biol. Chem. 249, 4428-4434]. The enzyme preparation described in this report contains four different types of polypeptide chains which may complex to form the active enzyme.

708|t|The cholinergic system and nociception in the primate: interactions with morphine.
708|a|In Experiment 1 the shock titration task was used to evaluate the antinoceptive properties of 5 different classes of cholinergic compounds in the rhesus monkey. Only scopolamine and high doses of physostigmine were effective in elevating the shock threshold. The apparent antinociceptive effect of physostigmine, however, was difficult to separate from its nonspecific behavioral depressant effect and was probably not related to an increase in cholinergic tone. Experiment 2 examined the interaction of morphine with arecoline, scopolamine and physostigmine. Only scopolamine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and high doses of physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) interacted with morphine in the shock titration paradigm. The multiplicative interaction of morphine with scopolamine was confirmed in Experiment 3 over a wider range of doses. It was concluded that morphine and the cholinergic compounds produce antinociceptive effects through different mechanisms of the pain system.

747|t|Colorimetric determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid and its N-acetylated metabolite on urine and feces.
747|a|A simple and convenient colorimetric method is described for the quantitative determination of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and N-acetyl-5-ASA in urine and feces after oral administration of salicylazosulfa-pyridine (SASP), the drug of choice in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. N-acetyl-5-ASA is extracted directly from the acidified biological specimen, deacetylated, and the liberated 5-ASA subjected to a modified Bratton-Marshall reaction. The 5-ASA present in the specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction. The violet colored product of the Bratton-Marshall reaction has a lambdamax of 560 nm and conforms to Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-70 umg/ml. Average recoveries (+/- S.D., N = 6) OF 5-ASA added to rat and human urine and rat fecal homogenates were 91.6 +/- 4.9%, 102 +/- 6.0%, and 71.0 +/- 4.8%, respectively. Interference by SASP and its sulfapyridine metabolities is negligible. As demonstrated, the colorimetric method is of sufficient sensitivity for application in most metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies conducted with SASP in laboratory animals and man.

749|t|Biochemical and biophysical changes in guinea pigs after acute head injury.
749|a|Animal experiments were set up mainly to derive additional diagnostic data from the study of biochemical changes after acute head injury. In standardized experiments guinea pigs were subjected in groups of 20 to three identical head injuries, each of either 1.0 J or 1.5 J intensity. The trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40 animals served as controls. During the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals. Superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings. Temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries. Blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 increased, compared with the control animals. The fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor (1.0 J) trauma. Of special significance was the increased activity of malate dehydrogenase and aldolase, found only in the blood of severely traumatized animals, as this could serve as an early diagnostic aid for evaluating head injuries.

783|t|The effect of pH upon fluoride uptake in intact enamel.
783|a|The relationship between pH and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using: (1) a sodium fluoride dentifrice, (2) a potassium fluoride + manganese chloride dentifrice, and (3) a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration. The first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different pH ranging from 7.1 to 4.5. This investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the pH was significant. The uptake of fluoride in the form of fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower pH level. The second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake (increase in fluoride content) from dentifrices in the same pH range. It was shown that the three agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake (about 50 parts/10(6)/min) at pH 6 and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was proportional to the hydrogen ion activity.

880|t|Further characterization of the association of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with reticulocyte membranes.
880|a|1. The behaviour and properties of membrane-bound GAPDH of rabbit reticulocytes were investigated. 2. The bound GAPDH is more resistant to inactivation by KCl than the soluble enzyme (allotopy). 3. The bound enzyme is released by electrolytes. This effect does not only depend on the ionic strength but additionally on the kind of ions, pH-value and protein concentration. 4. A comparison of the releasing effect of NAD analogues shows the necessity of the 5'-AMP moiety in the structure of the effector. 5. The represented results demonstrate the specifity of the GAPDH-membrane binding in rabbit reticulocytes.

882|t|Chemical relaxation studies on the system liver alcohol dehydrogenase, NADH and imidazole.
882|a|Several years ago, Theorell and Czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole, using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence. These early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in general terms. However, the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms. Furthermore, the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier (by factor 2). The data were evaluated much more rigorously than before, allowing an appropriate interpretation of the results. The observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes, which are faster than three (of the four) dissociation rate constants, determined previously by Theorell and McKinley-McKee.1,2 This fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence. However, the binding of imidazole to the binary enzyme-coenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes. The observed signal derives largely from the ternary complex(es). A substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed relaxation process, suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme. Nine models are considered with two types of coupling of pre-equilibria (none-all). Quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the four-step (bimolecular) cycle. The ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside. The interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole. If it would be shifted very much to the side of the "dead-end" complex (as in isobutyramide?!), stimulating action could not take place.

909|t|Ionic requirements of proximal tubular sodium transport. II. Hydrogen ion.
909|a|Simultaneous perfusion to proximal convoluted tubules and peritubular capillaries was used to study the effects of different perfusion fluids on sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, which was calculated as bicarbonate reabsorption and titratable acid. Results show that sodium reabsorption was not tightly coupled to hydrogen secretion. Bicarbonate stimulates both sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, but Tris stimulates only sodium reabsorption. Imposing an adverse chloride gradient across the proximal tubule (C1- peritubular greater than C1- luminal) decreased sodium reabsorption but did not diminish hydrogen secretion. Diamox inhibited both net sodium and hydrogen transport. It is concluded that there is not firm linkage between sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion and that bicarbonate probably stimulates sodium transport by a number of mechanisms, including an effect on the sodium transport unrelated to its ability to increase hydrogen ion secretion.

914|t|Overview: maintenance therapy in psychiatry: I. Schizophrenia.
914|a|Hospital psychiatry has evolved from long-term "treatment" programs that were primarily custodial to the successful pharmacological treatment of acute psychotic episodes. Unfortunately, many patients still return to the hospital with relapses. This so-called revolving door syndrome draws attention to the critical importance of preventing as well as treating acute episodes. In the first part of this overview, the author reviews the clinical literature on prophylactic treatment of schizophrenia with maintenance antipsychotic drugs. The second part will review the literature on prophylactic treatment of affective disorders with lithium and tricyclics. In the opinion of the author these drugs provide the potential for truly preventive psychiatry.

944|t|The membrane transport of ascorbic acid.
944|a|A system for measuring the rate of transport of dehydroascorbate into human red blood cells shows Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with substrate inhibition at levels above 150 muM DHA. The addition of sugars impairs this transport in the diminishing hierarchy D-glucose, D-mannose, D-xylose, D-galactose, L-lyxose, D-araboascorbate, L-sorbose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose. The effect of glucose on transport of ascorbate is marked at physiological levels. Transport of DHA is accelerated by copper ion and allows dehydroascorbate to move against a concentration gradient. The evidence supports the hypotheses proposing that hyperglycemia will impair the intracellular availability of vitamin C.

973|t|Nephrotic syndrome in indian children.
973|a|A clinicopathological study of 206 Indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed a primary renal cause in 195 (96%), of which 77% were boys. In 126 children (96 boys, 30 girls) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years. Renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome. Significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary 8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2, advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9. Nephritic manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years. Clearance of proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with minimal or mild renal histological changes. Our findings suggest that the pattern of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Indian children is similar to that reported from Western countries.

981|t|Studies of the pain produced by mafenide acetate preparations in burns.
981|a|In a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study, 37 patients were exposed to several formulations of mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon Cream) and their pain responses were recorded and converted to a semiquantitative pain index. The 11.2% concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5% concentration. Hypertonicity and not the pH level appears to be the cause of the pain produced by the high (11.2%) concentration. The tonicity of the cream carrier and 11.2% mafenide acetate are 1,080 mOsm/kg and 1,100 mOsm/kg, respectively, for a total of 2,180 mOsm/kg. The carrier cream without glycerol and a 5% concentration of mafenide cream were much less painful than the 11.2% concentration of mafenide. Both afforded a great deal of relief to the patients who received the medications.

1049|t|[On the pharmacology of 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335), a histamine and serotonin antagonist (author's transl)].
1049|a|The substance 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335) was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin, for its atropine-like properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with cyproheptadine and pimethixene. The anti-histamine and anti-serotonin activities of compound WA 335 on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of cyproheptadine but also that of pimethixene. WA 335 shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors. In the dose range in which it causes already an antamine effect, its oral absorption is very good. The anti-anaphylactic effect is much stronger than that of cyproheptadine. Like pimethixene and cyproheptadine, WA 335 has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin. The anticholinergic effects of WA 335 are dependent on the test object. In examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse, the atropine-like efficiency corresponds to that of cyproheptadine; it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than cyproheptadine on the stomach of the rat. WA 335 has distinct central atropine-like properties. It possesses a strong surface anesthetic activity. The effects of WA 335 on circulation are dependent on species. In contrast to pimethixene, compound WA 335 like cyproheptadine potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats. The reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after WA 335 than after pimethixene and corresponds to that produced by cyproheptadine. Higher doses of WA 335 than are necessary to demonstrate antaminic effects are needed to provoke central nervous effects. WA 335 shows no analgesic potency in mice. The influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of cyproheptadine. WA 335 is equally efficient as pimethixene with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice, and shows the same anti-emetic activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs. In contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of WA 335 which cause a slight sedation.

1053|t|[Treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with fungal lipase (author's transl)].
1053|a|7 patients suffering from severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have been treated with a lipolytic enzyme extracted from Rhizopus arrhizus. Comparing the fungal lipase with a placebo the drug lowered the daily stool weight from 809 g to 443 g on an average, i.e. by 45.2%. The steatorrhea was reduced from 75.6 g/24 h to 32.9 g, i.e. by 56.5%. When incubating the enzyme in vitro in saline solutions of different pH for 1 h the loss of lipolytic activity is 13% at pH 5, 15% at pH 4, and 19% at pH 3. So the enzyme, like fungal proteases, is almost not altered by hydrochloric acid at concentrations found physiologically in the stomach.

1088|t|Purine nucleotide pyrophosphotransferase from Streptomyces morookaensis, capable of synthesizing pppApp and pppGpp.
1088|a|Purine nucleotide pyrophosphotransferase was purified to apparent homogeneity from a culture filtrate of Streptomyces morookaensis. It is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 24 000-25 000, and its isoelectric point is 6.9. The enzyme synthesizes purine nucleoside 5'-phosphate (mono, di, or tri) 3'-diphosphates such as pppApp, ppApp, pApp, pppGpp, ppGpp and pppIpp by transferring a pyrophosphoryl group from the 5'-position of ATP, dATP and ppApp to the 3'-position of purine nucleotides. The purified enzyme catalysed the formation of 435 mumol of pppApp and 620 mumol of pppGpp from ATP and GTP per min mg protein under the standard conditions. The enzyme requires absolutely a divalent cation for activity, and optimum pH for the enzyme activity lay above 10 for Mg2+, for Co2+ and Zn2+ from 9 to 9.5, and for Fe2+ from 7.5 to 8. The following Michaelis constants were determined: AMP, 2.78 mM; ADP, 3.23 mM; GMP, 0.89 mM; GDP, 0.46 mM and GTP, 1.54 mM, in the case of ATP donor. The enzyme is inhibited by guanine, guanosine, dGDP, dGTP, N-bromosuccinimide, iodacetate, sodium borate and mercuric acetate.

1114|t|[Flourescent properties of histidine decarboxylase from Micrococcus sp. n].
1114|a|A dependency of fluorescence parameters of histidinedecarboxylase (HDC) from Micrococcuc sp. n. on pH values is studied. Native HDS has a short-waved maximum position (325 nm) and a small half-width of the fluorescence spectrum (48nm). The change in the quantum yield of the enzyme fluorescence was parallel with the change of the enzymatic activity. Triptophane residues of native HDC are located at hydrophobic region of the enzyme globula. The dependency of HDC flourescence parameters on pH values in 8 M urea was similar to that of free triptophane. A comparative study of fluorescences parameters of HDC and its inhibitory complexes with methyl ester of histidine (MEH), hydroxylamine and p-chloromercuriumbensoate is carried out. The effect of HDC interacting with inhibitors on fluorescence parameters of the enzyme is discussed. No differences were found in infra-red spectra of HDC and its inhibitory complex with MEH.

1147|t|L-[alphaS, 5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501): a new amino acid antibiotic with the properties of an antagonist of L-glutamine.
1147|a|L-[alphaS,5S]-alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (NSC-163501), an antibiotic elaborated by Streptomyces sviceus, has been shown to be a powerful inhibitor of many mammalian and bacterial reactions involving the transfer of nitrogen from the gamma-carboxamide of L-glutamine. Thus, the utilization of L-glutamine for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate, L-asparagine, guanosine-5'-monophosphate, cytidine-5'-triphosphate, N-formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide, NAD, glucosamine-6-phosphate, and anthranilic acid is strongly or totally inhibited by a concentration of NSC-163501 of 1 X 10(-3) M. L-Glutamate synthetase of Escherichia coli is only modestly inhibited and 5-phosphoribosylamine synthesis in fetal rat liver is comparatively refractory to inhibition. NSC-163501 treatment of L1210 cells growing in a low L-glutamine culture medium produced arrest in G or early S phase. Of the amino acids tested, only L-glutamine antagonized such growth inhibition.

1162|t|A stabilising factor for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in urine.
1162|a|Urinary gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) has been found to be stable when stored at room temperature and 4 degrees C. Activity is lost rapidly when urine is frozen but prior dialysis will prevent this loss. Urea is the major factor responsible for the loss of activity; albumin is protective at concentrations of 6 g/l or more. A factor of 10 000-30 000 molecular weight which will prevent the loss of urinary gamma-GT activity on freezing has been found in serum and urine; it has high potency in serum and in urine from patients with chronic renal failure, but only low potency in normal urine. Its nature is unknown but it is heat stable.

1223|t|Correlation of 14C-griseofulvin metabolism in rat liver microsomes, isolated perfused rat livers, and in rats with bile duct cannulas.
1223|a|The metabolism of 14C-griseofulvin has been compared in rat liver microsomes, isolated perfused rat livers, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In all three preparations, 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 6-desmethylgriseofulvin were the major metabolites. The ratio of total 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin formed was 1.20, 0.89, and 1.01 in liver microsomes, isolated perfused livers, and rats with bile duct cannulas, respectively. After a 7-min incubation with liver microsomes, most (96%) of the griseofulvin remained unchanged. Only small amounts of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1.26%) of dose) and 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (1.05% of dose) were formed. In isolated perfused liver, most of the drug (59% of dose) was excreted into bile within 4 hr, primarily as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (24% of dose) and 6-methylgriseofulvin (24% of dose). In animals with bile duct cannulas, 65% of the dose was excreted into bile and 18% of the dose into urine within 4 hours. In bile, 32% of the dose was excreted as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 20% of the dose as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, whereas in urine the drug was excreated predominantly as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (13% of dose) with only a small amount of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1% of dose), during the first 4 hr. These results show that there is good correlation in the metabolic fate of 14C-griseofulvin in the liver microsomes, isolated perfused liver, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In addition to the similar ratio of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, there is also an agreement in the extent of metabolism and biliary excretion in isolated perfused liver and in rats with bile duct cannulas, which suggests that the isolated perfused liver is an important technique for studying drug metabolism in animals.

1229|t|The gastrointestinal absorption of methadone in the rat.
1229|a|The absorption of dl-methadone from the gastrointestinal tract of the Sprague-Dawley rat was examined by the in vivo segment technique. Duodenal absorption, measured as a function of time and dose, followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15.6 min. Absorption was not influenced by prior or concomitant administration of a variety of drugs. Absorption from other regions of the intestine was similar to that from the duodenum; in contrast, absorption from the stomach was markedly slower. Gastric absorption was increased by alkalinization of stomach contents but was still considerably slower than from the duodenum. Gastric emptying of methadone appears to be the rate-limiting step in the overall gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, since the rate of emptying following intubation of the drug into the stomach was also considerably slower than the rate of duodenal absorption.

1232|t|Uptake and disposition of aldrin and dieldrin by isolated perfused rabbit lung.
1232|a|The uptake, metabolism, and release of aldrin and dieldrin by the lungs were studied by use of isolated perfused rabbit lungs that were artificially ventilated and perfused through the pulmonary artery. Both recirculating and single-pass experiments were conducted using an artificial medium as perfusate. Aldrin accumulated in the lung from the perfusate through two distinct phases of uptake: a rapid phase involving simple diffusion and nonspecific binding and a slower phase representing its metabolic turnover as dieldrin. Dieldrin was not metabolized but accumulated in the lungs by a saturable and a nonsaturable process. Single-pass experiments with aldrin indicated that the initial velocity of uptake could be fitted to one component and a constant representing the rate of metabolism. Uptake of dieldrin was biphasic: one phase independent of the perfusate concentration and the other saturable with respect to the perfusate concentration. By the application of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the maximum amount of dieldrin accumulation attributable to the saturable component was calculated to be 0.64 mumol/lung. Our results indicate that the accumulation of these chlorinated xenobiotics takes place through the processes of simple diffusion followed by nonspecific tissue binding. There was no evidence for irreversible binding of aldrin or dieldrin, its epoxide, in the lung. While the lung plays a role in metabolizing aldrin to dieldrin followed by a transient storage, neither substrate has the potential for long-term storage in the lung.

1233|t|Kinetic and spectral studies of type I and type II compounds with rat hepatic microsomes in the presence of the major metabolite of diphenylhydantoin.
1233|a|The nature of the inhibitory effects of the major metabolite of diphenylhydantoin, 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), on the in vitro metabolism of ethylmorphine and aniline by rat hepatic microsomes was examined. The N-demethylation of ethylmorphine was competitively inhibited by HPPH, whereas inhibition of the hydroxylation of aniline was not competitive. The spectrum produced by HPPH when added to microsomal suspensions does not resemble the classical type I or type II spectra, but rather a reversed type I spectrum. Spectral evidence is presented indicating that HPPH also diminishes the magnitude of the spectral change produced by type I and II compounds.

1243|t|Identification of "big" human placental lactogen in placenta and serum.
1243|a|Because of increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of polypeptide hormones, studies of the molecular species of human placental lactogen (hPL) were initiated. When extracts of freshly delivered human placentas were passed over Sephadex G-100 in 0.05M ammonium carbonate, three immunoreactive peaks were detected. In addition to a peak corresponding to native hPL (Kav = 0.39) and one in the void volume, a consistent peak which eluted before hPL (Kav = 0.20) was present. The latter represented 2-25% of total hormonal activity and could be rerun without significant conversion to hPL. In 8M urea, the peak continued to behave as a large molecular weight form on both Sephadex chromatography and on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Extraction procedures at both neutral and alkaline pH produced similar quantities of the larger material. [125I]iodo-hPL was not converted to the larger form by the conditions of extraction or analysis. These properties are consistent with a larger molecular weight, non-aggregated form of hPL. In comparison with the native hormone, the idsplacement curves for the larger form were parallel in radioimmunoassay studies. Sera obtained from pregnant women during various stages of gestation also showed consistent evidence for a large molecular weight form of the hormone. These observations provide direct evidence, both in placental tissue and in serum for "big" hPL.

1245|t|Differential effects of phenobarbital and pentobarbital on isolated nervous tissue.
1245|a|Epileptiform after discharges evoked by repetitive electrical stimulation of chronically isolated cortical slabs (cat) were shortened by low doses of phenobarbital but not affected by hypnotic doses of pentobarbital. Both pentobarbital and phenobarbital raised threshold and lowered spike amplitude in isolated sciatic nerves. The action of both drugs was increased by reducing Na in the medium and by decreasing the Ringer's pH. Similar to the action of other general anesthetics, the axonal effect of pentobarbital was enhanced by D2O replacement for H2O in the Ringer's (suggesting that tissue water is involved in pentobarbital action), whereas D2O replacement did not modify the action of phenobarbital or of local anesthetics. These results suggest that the varying in vivo effects of pentobarbital and phenobarbital may be due to a difference in their action upon excitable membranes (rather than to a different regional distribution in brain).

1251|t|The pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex from Azotobacter vinelandii. 2. Regulation of the activity.
1251|a|The presence of activators(AMP and sulphate) or inhibitors(acetyl-CoA) has no influence on the Hill coefficient of the S-shaped [pyruvate]--velocity curve of either the pyruvate-NAD+ overall reaction(h equals 2.5) or that of the pyruvate-K3Fe(CN)6 ACTIVITY OF THE FIRST ENZYME (H EQUALs 1.3). pH STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE Hill coefficient is dependent on subunit ionization within the pyruvate-containing complex and not on those in the free complex. It is concluded that pyruvate conversion rather that pyruvate binding is responsible for the allosteric pattern. The activity is due to absence of a protein kinase, mainly regulated at the acetyl-CoA/CoA, and NADH/NAD+ levels and by the value of the energy charge.

1257|t|D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Entner-Doudoroff enzyme) from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Purification, properties and regulation.
1257|a|1. The existence of two different D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases in Pseudomonas fluorescens has been demonstrated. Based on their different specificity and their different metabolic regulation one enzyme is appointed to the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the other to the hexose monophosphate pathway. 2. A procedure is described for the isolation of that D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase which forms part of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (Entner-Doudoroff enzyme). A 950-fold purification was achieved with an overall yield of 44%. The final preparation, having a specific activity of about 300 mumol NADH formed per min per mg protein, was shown to be homogeneous. 3. The molecular weight of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been determined to be 220000 by gel permeation chromatography, and that of the other enzyme (Zwischenferment) has been shown to be 265000. 4. The pI of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been shown to be 5.24 and that of the Zwischenferment 4.27. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme is stable in the range of pH 6 to 10.5 and shows its maximal activity at pH 8.9. 5. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme showed specificity for NAD+ as well as for NADP+ and exhibited homotropic effects for D-glucose 6-phosphate. It is inhibited by ATP which acts as a negative allosteric effector. Other nucleoside triphosphates as well as ADP are also inhibitory. 6. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the axial hydrogen at carbon-1 of beta-D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate to the si face of carbon-4 of the nicotinamide ring and must be classified as B-side stereospecific dehydrogenase.

1270|t|Acetylglucagon: preparation and characterization.
1270|a|Acetylated derivatives of glucagon have been prepared by reacting this hormone under various conditions with acetic anhydride. They have been chemically characterized by the use of a 14C-labeled reagent, by peptide mapping techniques following hydrolysis by pronase and chymotrypsin, and by spectroscopy. Acetylation in sodium acetate (pH 5.5) results in a full substitution of the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal histidyl residue, but in a partial (about 0.3 acetyl group per residue) substitution of the epsilon-amino group of the lysyl residue 12. The monosubstituted (on the alpha-amino group) and the disubstituted (on both amino groups) acetylated components have been separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose. Acetylation in sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) results in a complete substitution of both amino groups and of the hydroxyl groups of the tyrosyl residues 10 and 13. Complete deacetylation of the O-acetyltyrosyl residues occurs upon treatment with hydroxyl-amine. Mono, di and tetraacetylglucagon are homogeneous when analyzed by disc gel electrophoresis; di and tetrasubstituted derivatives show an increased mobility towards the anode. 125I-labeled derivatives of acetylglucagon show higher distribution coefficients in the aqueous two-phase dextran/poly(ethylene glycol) system than do similar derivatives of glucagon. Acetylation decreases in parallel the ability of glucagon to stimulate the activity of adenylate cyclase and to bind to its receptors in liver cell membranes of the rat. The biological potencies of the mono, di and tetrasubstituted derivates are, respectively, about 10, 1 and 0.1% that of native glucagon. The binding properties of the material dissociated from the acetylglucagon-receptor complex suggest that the reduction in biological activity results from a decrease in the intrinsic affinity of the modified glucagon for the receptors, as well as from the presence of small amounts of residual, unreacted glucagon. Studies with 125I-labeled derivatives of glucagon indicate that acetylation decreases the rate of association and increases the rate of dissociation of the hormone-receptor complex.

1351|t|Effect of the beta-receptor blocking agent Visken on the action of coumarin.
1351|a|In a double-blind study, the influence of Visken on the effect of anticoagulant therapy with Marcoumar was examined. In comparison to a placebo group, neither any influence on the Quick time, nor any increased tendency to haemorrhage bleeding could be detected.

1383|t|Derepression of certain aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes of Escherichia coli K-12 by growth in Fe3+-deficient medium.
1383|a|3-Deoxy-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase, prephenate dehydratase, tryptophan synthase, and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine synthase enzyme activities are derepressed in wild-type Escherichia coli K-12 cells grown on Fe3+-deficient medium. This derepression is reversed when FeSO4 is added to the growth medium. Addition of shikimic acid to the Fe3+-deficient growth medium caused repression of the first three enzyme activities but not of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine synthase activity. Addition of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid to the Fe3+-deficient growth medium has no effect on any of the above-mentioned enzyme activities. The Fe3+ deficiency-mediated derepression of 3-deoxyarabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase activity is due to an elevation of the tyrosine-sensitive isoenzyme; the phenylalanine-sensitive isoenzyme is not derepressed under these conditions.

1385|t|Studies on cytochrome oxidase. Partial resolution of enzymes containing seven or six subunits, from yeast and beef heart, respectively.
1385|a|Highly active, essentially homogeneous, preparations of ferrocytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) have been obtained from both yeast and beef heart by extraction with cholate, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and replacement of cholate by Tween 20. The molecular weights of the resultant proteins equal 260 +/- 23 X 10(3) and 205 +/- 10(3); they contain seven and six different polypeptide subunits, respectively, all in equimolar amounts, with apparent molecular weights of 42.4, 34.1, 24.7, 14.6, 14.6, 12.3, 10.6 X 10(3), and 47.5, 20.4, 14.5, 14.5, 13.0, 11.0 X 10(3), respectively. By means of apolar chromatography on L-leucine coupled to agarose these enzymes can be stripped of their largest subunit(s) resulting in preparations with molecular weights of 170 +/- 17 X 10(3) and 124 +/- 20 X 10(3), and containing only five polypeptides, with the largest remaining one (molecular weight congruent to 20 X 10(3)) present in less than stoichiometric amounts. This interconversion and subunit removal has been monitored by exclusion chromatography, four systems of acrylamide gel electrophoresis--some with the protein labeled with 125I under denaturing conditions--isoelectric focusing, and hydrodynamic methods. It has virtually no effect on heme a and copper content and on the catalytic parameters of the enzymes. We conclude that subunits I and II in enzymes from fungal, and subunit I in those from animal, sources are dispensable for the catalysis of the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by, and are probably not essential for the attatchment of prosthetic groups to, these proteins.

1407|t|[Template chromatography on immobilized oligonucleotides. Synthesis and application of oligodeoxyadenosine-5'-phosphate--DEAE-cellulose (author's transl)].
1407|a|Oligomers of deoxyadenylic acid, obtained by polycondensation, were covalently attached to polyvinyl alcohol. These polymer-bound oligonucleotides undergo very strong adsorption on DEAE-cellulose such that at neutral pH and with 1 M NaCl, partial desorbtion occurs only above 60 degrees. The use of this PV(pA)n-DEAE-cellulose for the column chromatographic separation of deoxythymidylic acid oligomers obtained by polycondensation, according to the principle of base-pairing, is discussed. Linear oligomers and also pyrophosphate derivatives of thymidylic acid which contain more than five monomer units undergo strong retardation under the conditions of base-pairing. Cyclic oligonucleotides do not show any noticeable interaction with the stationary phase. Thus, through the use of a temperature gradient, it is possible to fractionally separate the polycondensate, giving an average degree of polymerisation of 6--10.

1412|t|High-resolution liquid chromatographic analysis of methylated purine and pyrimidine bases in transfer RNA.
1412|a|Methylated and major purine and pyrimidine bases were separated and quantified by high-resolution liquid chromatography after hydrolyzing transfer ribonucleic acids (tRNAs). Separation was accomplished by eluting the hydrolyzed samples from an anion-exchange column with a concentration gradient of ammonium acetate at pH 9.2. Isolated sample of tRNA were hydrolyzed to the free bases with a trifluoroacetic acid-formic acid mixture of 200 degrees. Detection limits of 100-200 ng/ml were measured for the methylated bases; analytical data are reported for ten methylated bases plus the four major bases of calf liver and rat liver tRNA.

1461|t|Analysis of an L-histidinol-utilizing mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
1461|a|Transductional analysis was applied to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant PAO14 (hnc-1). This mutant can utilize L-histidinol as sole source of carbon and nitrogen and has a 60-fold increased histidinol dehydrogenase (HDH) content (Dhawale, Creaser & Loper, 1972). Transductional analysis was carried out using 18 histidine-requiring mutants to see where the hnc-1 locus maps in relation to the structural genes of histidine biosynthesis. The hnc-1 marker cotransduced with group IV genes at 97 to 100 % and not at all with group I, which is known to be the structural gene for HDH. The data obtained in the studies of Km (histidinol) and Km (NAD), and the effect of pH and temperature on the HDH activity from PAO1 and PAO14 are in full agreement with the genetic data that the hnc-1 mutation is not in the structural gene for HDH. It is suggested that hnc-1 may be a mutation in a regulatory gene affecting HDH synthesis in PAO14 and may map close to his-IV whose function in histidine biosynthesis is not known.

1466|t|Basic and neutral amino acid transport in Aspergillus nidulans.
1466|a|Arginine and methionine transport by Aspergillus nidulans mycelium was investigated. A single uptake system is responsible for the transport of arginine, lysine and ornithine. Transport is energy-dependent and specific for these basic amino acids. The Km value for arginine is 1 X 10(-5) M, and Vmax is 2-8 nmol/mg dry wt/min; Km for lysine is 8 X 10(-6) M; Kt for lysine as inhibitor of arginine uptake is 12 muM, and Ki for ornithine is mM. On minimal medium, methionine is transported with a Km of 0-I mM and Vmax about I nmol/mg dry wt/min; transport is inhibited by azide. Neutral amnio acids such as serine, phenylalanine and leucine are probably transported by the same system, as indicated by their inhibition of methionine uptake and the existence of a mutant specifically impaired in their transport. The recessive mutant nap3, unable to transport neutral amino acids, was isolated as resistant to selenomethionine and p-fluorophenylanine. This mutant has unchanged transport of methionine by general and specific sulphur-regulated permeases.

1483|t|The meaning of the Leydig cell in relation to the etiology of cryptorchidism: An experimental electron-microscopic study.
1483|a|In our electron-microscopic studies of testicular biopsies, both normal and cryptorchid, we found a simple atrophy of the Leydig cell in the cryptorchid testis. Based on experiments by Raynaud1,2 and Jean3 on pregnant mice, we tried to find the reason for changes in the Leydig cell relating to the etiology of cryptorchidism. We found on electron microscopic study of testes in the offspring of pregnant mice treated with estrogen the same atrophy of the Leydig cell as we see in human cryptorchidism. These changes are not evident when estrogen and HCG are given together. We can conclude from this experiment that lack of gonadotropin stimulation leads to the atrophy of Leydig cells. This atrophy then produces a lack of androgen which could be responsible for cryptorchidism.

1519|t|Barbiturates block calcium uptake by stimulated and potassium-depolarized rat sympathetic ganglia.
1519|a|The effects of two barbiturates on calcium uptake by sympathetic ganglia have been examined. Sodium pentobarbital (0.4-0.75 mM) and sodium thiopental (0.3 mM) block the preganglionic stimulation-induced uptake of 45Ca by rat superior cervical ganglia but not action potential conduction in the presynaptic axons. The ganglionic-blocking agent, tetraethylammonium, does not inhibit stimulation-induced Ca uptake and does not prevent the blocking effect of thiopental. This effect is therefore probably presynaptic. Postassium-rich media also stimulate Ca uptake by the ganglia, and this effect is markedly inhibited by pentobarbital. Since the K stimulation effect is also observed in deafferented ganglia but not in guanethidine-denervated ganglia, this effect is probably associated primarily with postsynaptic elements. In sum, the data suggest that the barbiturates inhibit Ca permeability changes in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons.

1529|t|Transfer of gases and metabolites in the equine placenta: a comparison with other species.
1529|a|Mares and fetuses with indwelling catheters in the umbilical and uterine vessels have been used to monitor transplacental blood gas tensions, pH, O2 affinities and the concentration of various metabolites in fetal and maternal blood during late gestation. Measurements of umbilical and uterine blood flows and arterio-venous differences enabled the uptake of O2 and glucose by the fetus and the uterus to be estimated. The present findings are compared with those from other species in comparable conditions.

1541|t|Formation of nucleoside 5'-polyphosphates from nucleotides and trimetaphosphate.
1541|a|When solutions of nucleoside 5'-phosphates and trimetaphosphate are dried out at room temperature, nucleoside 5'-polyphosphates are formed. The Mg++ ion shows a superior catalytic function in this reaction when compared with other divalent metal ions. Starting with nucleoside 5'-phosphates, Mg++ and trimetaphosphate, the predominant products in the nucleoside 5'-polyphosphate series pnN are p4N, P7N and p10N. Nucleoside 5'-diphosphates yield p5N and p8N, nucleoside 5'-triphosphates give p6N and p9N. The prebiological relevance of these reactions is discussed.

1573|t|[The influence of isoglaucon on the hydrodynamics and haemodynamics of the eye (author's transl)].
1573|a|By animal experiments and clinically we could prove that isoglaucon instillation caused the decrease in IOP due to both increase in outflow and reduction of humor secretion; the IOP decrease and changes in hydrodynamics being manifested more markedly in the fellow-eye. As reoophthalmography demonstrated "Isoglaucon" produced lumen narrowing in the anterior portion of the uveal tract. "Isoglaucon" was prescribed to 20 patients having open-angle-glaucoma, Two hours after instillation the 23 decreased in 26 eyes (of 28) by 9.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. When prescribed regularly "Isoglaucon" raised the outflow facility coefficient from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.20 +/-0.02. The secretion decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.15. Thus, IOP decrease after "Isoglaucon" is accounted for by both improved outflow and reduction of aqueous humor secretion. The "isoglucon" instillation produced a rather moderate decrease in the total arterial pressure, though no expected parallelism in arterial and intraocular pressure was marked.

1639|t|[Panarteritis nodosa-Special aspects of glucocorticoid and immune suppressive therapy (author's transl)].
1639|a|Report dealing with the clinical and pathoanatomical course as well as the autopsy findings in a 54 year old female suffering from panarteritis nodosa. Onset of the illness with polyneuritis and arthralgia. One year later diagnosis of panarteritis nodosa verified by muscle biopsy. Deterioration of the disease leading to the development of peripheral gangrene could not be prevented in spite of intensive therapy with steroids, immune suppressive agents, digitalis and antihypertensive drugs. Death 4 years later by myocardial infarction. Autopsy revealed generalized healed panarteritis nodosa with scarring and obliteration of vessels. A short description of the symptoms of the disease is given and the efficacy of the therapy with steroids and immune suppressive drugs is discussed from the clinical as well as the pathoanatomical point of view. Immunopathologic mechanisms are considered to be the responsible factors for pathogenesis.

1686|t|Studies on the mechanism of the action of morphine on the peristalsis of guinea pig ileum in situ.
1686|a|The influence of some drugs on the effect of morphine on the threshold pressure required to elicit peristalsis in the guinea pig ileum in situ was studied, in order to test the hypothesis that this effect of morphine is mediated by catecholamine release. Tachyphylaxis to this effect of morphine was confirmed. Pretreatemnt with two 8 mg/kg doses of reserpine, 24 and 48 hrs before the experiment, significantly reduced the effect of morphine on the pressure threshold. The i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg dl-Dopa re-established the effect of morphine in reserpinized animals to the level of the untreated controls. Pretreatment with guanethidine (15 mg/kg) decreased and even prevented this effect of morphine. Phentolamine pretreatment (10 mg/kg) also significantly inhibited the effect of morphine. Neither DCI nor propranolol influenced this morphine effect. Pretreatment with reserpine, guanethidine or phentolamine reduced the basic pressure threshold needed to elicit peristalsis. The possibility that the decrease of local circulation induced by hypotenison would reduce the local concentration of morphine was rejected because the same doses of guanethidine or phentolamine did not modify the effect of hexamethonium given i.v. in this preparation. All these results support the idea that the effect of morphine on intestinal peristalsis is mediated by a catecholamine acting on alpha-receptors, e.g. norepinephrine.

1690|t|Concanavalin A-binding glycopeptides from rat brain glycoproteins.
1690|a|The affinity of concanavalin A for neutral and acidic glycopeptides derived from rat brain glycoproteins was investigated by studying the inhibition of a concanavalin A-glycogen precipitation system. The neutral, mannose-rich glycopeptides obtained by column electrophoresis of the dialyzable glycopeptides that had been solubilized by proteolytic treatment of defatted brain tissue were powerful inhibitors, with an inhibitory activity 20 to 26 times that of the standard inhibitor, methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. The acidic sialoglycopeptides had activities one to nine times that of the mannoside. Therefore, both acid and neutral glycopeptides were capable of interacting with concanavalin A. The especially strong affinity of the neutral mannose-rich glycopeptides, however, enabled their retention on concanavalin A-Sepharose and subsequent elution with methyl-alpha-D-mannoside. This provided the means of separation of the acidic sialoglycopeptides from the neutral, mannose-rich glycopeptides by affinity chromatography. Glycopeptides that contain N-acetylgalactosamine are not retained by concanavalin A-Sepharose.

1709|t|Effects of cyanide and doxapram during hypothermia.
1709|a|The ventilatory responses, blood gases and acid-base status to intravenous injections of KCN and doxapram hydrochloride were studied in anesthetized dogs during normothermia and at two levels of hypothermia. In the normothermic animal, KCN evoked significant elevations of minute and alveolar ventilations. For the mildly hypothermic (32-33 degrees C) dog, minute and alveolar ventilations were proportionally greater than for normothermia. Bolus infusions of KCN to deeply hypothermic dogs (28-29 degrees C) elicited larger and nearly similar increases of minute and alveolar ventilations as compared, respectively, with normothermia and mild hypothermia. Compared to their controls, injections of doxapram during normothermia, mild and deep hypothermia augmented VE 43.3%, 63.6% and 31.5%, respectively. With doxapram there was a feeble increase in alveolar ventilation. These results demonstrate that the peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptors preserve the capacity to respond to stimuli given acutely while lowering core temperature and in some circumstances this capacity is even enhanced as compared to normothermia.

1715|t|The effect of alpha, alpha1-dipyridyl on noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels and on dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity in brain.
1715|a|The effects of alpha, alpha1-dipyridyl (DP) on noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in rat and mouse brain and on dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) activity in rat brain have been studied, DP decreases NA level and inhibits DbetaH activity in a dose dependent manner, without affecting DA or 5-HT levels.

1797|t|Cyclic-AMP and pancreatic bicarbonate secretion in response to secretin in dogs.
1797|a|In anesthetized dogs given secretin intravenously in doses doubling every 60 min and ranging from 0.5 to 8 units per kg body weight per hr, cyclic-AMP levels in pancreatic tissue rose continuously, whereas DNA concentrations were slightly decreased. Bicarbonate concentrations and bicarbonate outputs, cyclic-AMP tissue concentrations and bicarbonate outputs, as well as cyclic-AMP tissue concentrations and juice outputs, were significantly correlated. In conscious pancreatic fistula dogs, there was also a significant correlation between cyclic-AMP and bicarbonate concentrations and outputs in the pancreatic juice after stimulation by exogenous secretin. Accordingly, enhanced release of endogenous secretin achieved by intraduodenal acidification led to a dose-dependent increase in bicarbonate and cyclic-AMP outputs in both conscious and anesthetized dogs. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (aminophylline, caffeine, and papaverine) given alone to the conscious dogs did not initiate pancreatic bicarbonate secretion, but they potentiated bicarbonate responses to exogenous secretin. These data suggest that cyclic-AMP plays a part in secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion.

1860|t|[Determination of barbiturates from biological material].
1860|a|A trace quantitative analysis of barbiturates has been carried out in blood, urine, organs and in gastric and intestinal concents. The amount of sample required for analysis is very small [approximately 400 mul blood]. Extraction is carried out four times with the mixture of acetone and either 1:1]. The preparation of columns, packing and standards has been described. The device used for the analyses [Chrom 3] is furnished with an adjusted feeding block preventing the decomposition of samples in the doser. The column temperature is 190 degrees C, the column packing is Chromaton N-AW-DMCS coated with 3% NPGS and 0.75% trimer acid, detector FID.

1902|t|[Analysis of inhibition in pathways of NADP.H2 and NAD.H2 oxidation in liver tissue microsomes].
1902|a|Microsomal complexes of electron transfer were resistant to typical inhibitors of mitochondrial pathway of electron transport. In oxidation of NADP.H2 there were at least three point of molecular O2 reduction: NADP.H2-specific flavoprotein, Fe2+ participating in reactions of peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and cytochrome P-450. Efficiency of cytochrome P-450 inhibitors could not be evaluated by polarography as in the pathway several sites of molecular O2 activation were observed. In oxidation of NADP.H2 estimation of the rate of electron transfer reactions was carried out by monitoring of velocity of O2 absorption in presence of EDTA (inhibitor of the reaction of peroxidation) because about 50% of the total oxygen were utilized only in the process where NADP.H2 was oxidized. NAD.H2 oxidation, inhibited with EDTA, was activated by addition of Ca2+.

1984|t|Studies on malaria and responses of Anopheles balabacensis balabacensis and Anopheles minimus to DDT residual spraying in Thailand.
1984|a|Studies on malaria and on A. b. balabacensis and A. minimus responses to DDT spraying were conducted in a forested hilly area in northern Thailand. In a first phase, base-line data were collected from July 1970 to March 1972. In a second phase, the study area received five round of DDT spraying over a period of two years and at the same time all malaria infections received radical treatment. During this two-year period of field operations, entomological and epidemiological observations were continued. The studies carried out in the second phase, showed that malaria transmission decreased under the applied optimum anti-malarial measures but was not interrupted. Human ecology and population movement inside the forest, especially during the dry season, contributed to a great extent to this result. The transmission occurring in the early part of the monsoon season clearly indicates the importance of the timing of DDT spraying. A. b. balabacensis appeared to be transmitting malaria all the year round in the deep forest but only in the monsoon season in the forest fringe. The vectorial capacity of both vectors was estimated separately for indoor and outdoor populations. The pre-spraying values obtained for A. b. balabacensis were much higher thaan for A. minimus. After DDT spraying A. b. balabacensis showed a decrease in vectorial capacity estimated at 31.5 times for the indoor population and 18 times for the outdoor population. A. minimus, on the other hand, showed a much smaller decrease, estimated at 6.8 and 1.9 times for the indoor and outdoor populations respectively.

2016|t|Effect of sodium nitrate loading on electrolyte transport by the renal tubule.
2016|a|Effects of sodium nitrate were compared with sodium chloride loading on transport of electrolytes by the nephron. Maximal levels of free water clearance/clomerular filtration rate (CH2O/GFR) averaged 8.4% with nitrate loading and 14.4% with saline loading. Since ethacrynic acid and chlorothiazide exert their major natriuretic effect in the distal nephron, the increment in Na ad Cl reabsorbed beyond the proximal tubule. The administration of these agents resulted in an increase in fractional sodium excretion (CNa/GFR) of 21.1%, urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) of 1,126 mueq/min, and urinary chloride excretion (UClV) of 848 mueq/min during nitrate loading compared with an increase in CNa/GFR of 37.6%, UNaV of 2,362 mueq/min, and UClV of 2,397 mueq/min during saline loading. The smaller diuretic-induced increment in Na and Cl excretion in the nitrate studies suggests, as do the hydrated studies, that less Cl and Na are reabsorbed in the distal nephron during nitrate than saline loading. At every level of UNaV, fractional bicarbonate reabsorption was higher, urine pH was lower, and urinary potassium excretion (UKV) was higher in the nitrate studies. Thus, compared with saline loading, sodium nitrate decreases chloride and sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. The higher hydrogen and potassium secretion in the nitrate studies may be consequent to the decreased ability of the distal nephron to reabsorb chloride.

2088|t|[Spectrofluorometric determination of a new beta-blocking agent, acebutolol in blood and urine].
2088|a|The authors describe a simple method of spectrofluorimetric estimation of acebutolol, applicable to blood and urine, sufficiently sensitive to obtain therapeutic concentrations. After administration of a 200 mg dose by mouth, one may observe a maximal plasma concentration 3 hours later, with average values of 1.02 +/- 0.20 mg/liter. The principle of the estimation is based on acid hydrolysis of the product, then condensation of the liberated amine with nitroso-1 naphtol-2 to give a fluorescent derivative (stimulation 460 nm, emission 545 nm).

2096|t|[Use of lincomycin, methicillin and ristomycin in the nutrient media for isolating pathogenic intestinal microorganisms].
2096|a|Elective-differentiating solid nutrient media for simultaneous isolation of Vibrioes, Salmonella and Shigella were developed. Antibiotics active against grampostive microflora and dry bile salts inhibiting the growth of Proteus were used as the inhibitors of the growth of the accompanying microflora. The medium was lincomycin and the bile salts may be prepared in a dry form.

2149|t|Effect of prednisolone and salicyclic acid on ionic fluxes across the human stomach.
2149|a|We compared ionic fluxes across human gastric mucosa after instillation of test solutions of isotonic hydrochloric acid alone or containing salicylic acid, or prednisolone or both. Prednisolone produced no alteration in fluxes of H+ and Na+ ions compared with controls. Salicyclic acid induced a significant net loss of H+ ions and gain of Na+ ions indicating alteration of the gastric mucosal barrier. Combined salicyclic acid plus prednisolone produced no increase in permeability of gastric mucosa to H+ and Na+ ions or to salicylic acid itself. Prednisolone was not appreciably absorbed from the stomach while salicylic acid was well absorbed. Combination of salicylic acid and prednisolone did not increase absorption of either drug. Neither salicylic acid nor prednisolone solutions alone or combined caused an increase in pepsin output over that due to 160 mM HCl. Salicylic acid resulted in a significant fall in potential difference compared to control while prednisolone produced no change in the one subject studied. In acute studies in man prednisolone is not absorbed from the stomach, does not itself affect the gastric mucosal barrier nor pepsin output nor does it enhance the absorption of or effect of salicylic acid on gastric ionic fluxes or pepsin output.

2278|t|The structure of the covalent adduct formed by the interaction of 3-dimethylamino-1-propyne and the flavine of mitochondrial amine oxidase.
2278|a|3-Dimethylamino-1-propyne irreversibly inactivates mitochondrial monoamine oxidase from bovine liver. The inactivation results in the loss of absorption in the 450-500-nm region of the flavine spectrum and a concomitant increase in absorbance at 410 nm. For the enzyme-bound adduct epsilon410 = 28000. The spectral properties of the adduct of the liver enzyme with 3-dimethylamino-1-propyne are similar to those observed when the pig kidney enzyme is inactivated with pargyline (Chuang et al. (1974), J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2381). From a proteolytic digest of the enzyme inactivated with labeled inhibitor a flavine peptide has been isolated which contains 1 mol of inactivator/mol of flavine. The chemical and spectral properties of the adduct are those of compounds containing the structure --N--CH==CH--CH==N+ less than. It was concluded that the flavine-inhibtor adduct is a N-5 substituted dihydroflavine and its structure has been determined.

2281|t|ATPase of Escherichia coli: purification, dissociation, and reconstitution of the active complex from the isolated subunits.
2281|a|A simple procedure for the purification of Mg2+-stimulated ATPase of Escherichia coli by fractionation with poly(ethylene glycols) and gel filtration is described. The enzyme restores ATPase-linked reactions to membrane preparations lacking these activities. Five different polypeptides (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon) are observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. Freezing in salt solutions splits the enzyme complex into subunits which do not possess any catalytic activity. The presence of different subunits is confirmed by electrophoretic and immunological methods. The active enzyme complex can be reconstituted by decreasing the ionic strength in the dissociated sample. Temperature, pH, protein concentration, and the presence of substrate are each important determinants of the rate and extent of reconstitution. The dissociated enzyme has been separated by ion-exchange chromatography into two major fragments. Fragment IA has a molecular weight of about 100000 and contains the alpha, gamma, and epsilon polypeptides. The minor fragment, IB, has about the same molecular weight but contains, besides alpha, gamma, and epsilon, the delta polypeptide. Fragment II, with a molecular weight of about 52000, appears to be identical with the beta polypeptide. ATPase activity can be reconstituted from fragments IA and II, whereas the capacity of the ATPase to drive energy-dependent processes in depleted membrane vesicles is only restored after incubation of these two fractions with fraction IB, which contains the delta subunit.

2307|t|Purification and some properties of rat liver cysteine oxidase (cysteine dioxygenase).
2307|a|Cysteine oxidase (cysteine dioxygenase, EC 1.13.11.20) was purified approximately 1000-fold from rat liver. The purified enzyme (protein-B) was obtained as an inactive form, which was activated by anaerobic preincubation with L-cysteine. The active form of protein-B was inactivated during aerobic incubation to produce cysteine sulfinate. This inactivation of protein-B was protected by a distinct protein in rat liver cytoplasm, namely stabilizing protein (protein-A). The Ka and Km values for L-cysteine were 0.8-10(-3) M and 1.3-10(-3) M respectively. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by Cu+ and/or Fe2+ chelating agents but not by Cu2+ chelating agent. The optimum pH of enzyme reaction was 8.5-9.5 while that of enzyme activation was 6.8-9.5, with a broad peak.

2319|t|Immunological similarity between NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes and liver microsomes.
2319|a|In a number of animal species soluble NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of erythrocytes was compared with membrane-bound NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of liver microsomes by using an antibody to purified NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from rat liver microsomes. The results obtained indicated clearly that they are immunologically very similar to each other. The data with erythrocyte ghosts suggested that cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase are also present in the ghost.

2328|t|[Various properties of the creatine transport system and the location of creatine kinase in skeletal muscle mitochondria].
2328|a|Water and creatine contents were studied in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria after their 5 min. incubation in creatine solutions, pH 7.2 or 8.4. The content of water and creatine in mitochondria was found to be higher at pH 8.4, than at pH 72, the creatine content correlated with the water content. Structural creatine analogues, containing aminogroups with pKa greater than or equal to 9.5 or carboxyl groups, inhibited the infusion of creatine into mitochondria more strongly than substances having aminogroups with pKa less than 5. The penetrating form is creatine amphiion; the effect of pH on the permeability is probably due to the activation of the creatine transmitter. Rat skeletal muscle mitochondria contain creatine kinase at both sides of the inner membrane. This conclusion is based on the fact that under conditions, supplying the direct course of the creatine kinase reaction (the incubation medium contains Ca2+ and creatine; pH 7.8), ADP produces the stimulation of mitochondrial respiration up to the oxygen exhausting in a polarographic unit. Similarly, ADP irreversibly stimulates mitochondrial respiration in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, if EDTA and ADP are added after the preincubation of mitochondria in creatine-containing medium and after accumulating small amounts of Ca2+ by mitochondria.

2331|t|[Reaction ability and alkylation kinetics of sulfhydride groups of soluble succinate dehydrogenase].
2331|a|Inhibition kinetics of succinate--an acceptor of oxidoreductase activity of soluble succinate dehydrogenase by N-ethylmaleimide is studied. The alkylation reaction is described by the kinetic equation of the first order, its stechiometric coefficient being 1. The binding of enzyme sulphhydride groups by p-chloromercuriumbenzoate blocks the enzyme alkylation and its inhibition by oxaloacetate. Succinate protects succinate dehydrogenase from the inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide. The reaction of the enzyme with an alkylating agent in the presence of different substrate concentrations corresponds kinetically to the model, according to which a sulphhydride group acts in the active site of the enzyme. pKa of this group is 7.0 at 20degreesC. The dependency of the maximal substrate oxidation reaction rate and that of the enzyme alkylation rate on pH coinside at the pH range 5.8--7.8. The presence of anions in the alkylation medium decreases the reaction ability of the active site with respect to N-ethylmaleimide. A mechanism of the initial stage of succinate oxidation with the cooperation of the sulphhydride group of the enzyme active site is postulated.

2345|t|Oxygen transport by haemoglobin. A comparison of whole blood, washed erythrocytes and haemoglobin solution.
2345|a|The properties of haemoglobin oxygen transport were compared under three different conditions: red cell in its natural medium, i.e. plasma (whole blood), washed red cell and haemoglobin A, the former suspended, the latter solved in an iso-osmotic tris buffer. The oxygen haemoglobin affinity (expressed as P50) and the respiratory Bohr effect variations were studied with modified media and unchanged pH and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration. Provided they are refered to intra-erythrocytic pH, none of these values were changed when varying environment. These results suggest that the three major ligands (H+ ions, 2,3-DPG and CO2) interaction with haemoglobin is largely predominant upon other factors which would interfere, and can completely account for oxygen transport by haemoglobin.

2349|t|The self-association of adenosine-5'-triphosphate studied by circular dichroism at low ionic strengths.
2349|a|The self-association of adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was studied as a function of pH, additional counterions, concentration and temperature. Circular dichroism measurements were employed as a measure of the base-stacking. The self-association of ATP is pH dependent with the protonation of the adenine ring helping stabilize the association. Highly charged counterions alter this aggregation. At pH 2.8 and 20 degrees C, a dimerization constant of 88 M-1 is obtained, while an isodesmic model leads to an equilibrium constant of 158 M-1. With increasing pH, the association constants decrease. At pH 2.8 there is a very strong temperature dependence of the CD amplitude. These results indicate the existence of additional electrostatic stabilization for the stacking of the adenine rings. At acidic pHs, models are proposed to explain this high degree of stability and a calculation of the approximate electrostatic contribution to the aggregation shows it to be of the proper magnitude.

2395|t|Lipoamide dehydrogenase in serum: a preliminary report.
2395|a|Lipoamide dehydrogenase was identified in serum and the optimal conditions for its assay at 30 degrees C were defined. The pH optimum in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer is 7.8, and activity is inhibited if buffer concentration exceeds 100 mmol/liter. Saturating concentrations of the substrates NAD+ and lipoamide are 3 mmol/liter and 5 mmol/liter, respectively. Activity is decreased eightfold when lipoic acid is substituted for lipoamide. Activity is linearly related to enzyme concentration up to limiting absorbance change of 0.300 at 340 nm, and both within-day and day-to-day precision are satisfactory. Data suggest a normal range (2 SD) of 3-19 kU/liter. The highest value measured in serum was 473 kU/liter. A correlation with direct bilirubin concentrations (r equals 0.435, P less than 0.01) was found.

2530|t|D-glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium M 1286: purification, properties and structure.
2530|a|1) Glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium has been purified to a specific activity of 550 U per mg protein. The homogeneity of the purified enzyme was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. 2) The amino acid composition has been determined. 3) The molecular weight of the native enzyme was found to be 116000 by gel permeation chromatography, in good agreement with the values of 120000 and 118000, which were ascertained electrophoretically according to the method of Hedrick and Smith and by density gradient centrifugation, respectively. 4) In the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate and 8M urea, the enzyme dissociates into subunits with a molecular weight of 30000 as determined by dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis. These values indicate that the native enzyme is composed of four polypeptide chains, each probably possessing one coenzyme binding site, which can be concluded from fluorescent titration of the NADH binding sites. 5) In polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis, samples of the purified enzyme exhibit three bands of activity, which present the native (tetrameric) form of glucose dehydrogenase and two monomeric forms (molecular weight 30000), arising under the conditions of pH and ionic strength of this method. 6) The enzyme shows a sharp pH optimum at pH 8.0 in Tris/HCl buffer, and a shift of the pH optimum to pH 9.0 in acetate/borate buffer. The limiting Michaelis constant at pH 9.0 for NAD is 4.5 mM and 47.5 mM for glucose. The dissociation constant for NAD is 0.69 mM. 7) D-Glucose dehydrogenase is highly specific for beta-D-glucose and is capable of using either NAD or NADP. The enzyme is insensitive to sulfhydryl group inhibitors, heavy metal ions and chelating agents.

2567|t|A histochemical study of the apparent deamination of proteins by sodium hypochlorite.
2567|a|The possible chemical mechanisms by which neutral solutions of sodium hypochlorite containing a high concentration of sodium chloride abolish the acidophilia of proteins in sections of fixed tissue are reviewed. The most probable one is the chlorination of the protein terminal amino groups, followed by the breakdown of the N-chloramine so formed into alpha-ketocarboxylic acid, nitrile or aldehyde groups. Hypochlorite solutions certainly do not deaminate tissue sections as was previously thought. Experimental evidence for the formation of relatively stable N-chloramine groups in situ and their limited conversion to aldehydes is reported. For example, the acidophilia of hypochlorite-treated sections was found to be restored after flooding them with hydriodic acid followed by the extraction of the liberated iodine with an alcohol. The significance of these experimental findings is discussed.

2573|t|Ontogeny of tracheal fluid, pulmonary surfactant, and plasma corticoids in the fetal lamb.
2573|a|We examined fetal plasma corticoids and flow rate, electrolyte composition, and surfactant content of tracheal fluid in chronic experiments with eight fetal lambs. From 120 to 148 days of gestation the rate of fluid production was 4.5 ml/kg per h, and there was no change in mean fluid sodium (147.8 meq/1), chloride (153.1 meq/1), calcium (2.2 mg/100 ml), and pH (6.23). Tracheal fluid potassium increased from 4.3 meq/1 at 120-130 days to 8.9 meq/1 at term, while plasma sodium, chloride, calcium, pH, and potassium were constant at 146.1 meq/1, 110.0 meq/1, 12.1 mg/100 ml, 7.39, and 4.0 meq/1, respectively. Plasma corticoids were less than 1.5 mug/100 ml total (0.3 mug/100 ml free) until 130 days, when they increased rapidly to 10.5 total (3.2 free) at 148 days. Surfactant was first detected in tracheal fluid between 124 and 133 days and its secretion increased rapidly after 135 days to a value of 125 mug/kg per h at 148 days. A sudden increase in fetal plasma corticoids does not seem to be the stimulus for appearance of surfactant in the lamb, although these hormones may induce the rapid accumulation of surfactant prior to delivery.

2622|t|Use of anaerobic culture for the improved isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
2622|a|The following report compares the results of aerobic and anaerobic cultivation for the primary isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) from the respiratory tract of children. Of 414 specimens of respiratory tract secretions cultured, 65 (15-7%) yielded pneumococci; 31 (47-7%) grew both aerobically and anaerobically, but 34 (52-3%) strains were isolated only from the anaerobic culture. Pneumococci cultured anaerobically with added carbon dioxide characteristically produce large mucoid colonies which are more easily distinguished than the 'normal' colonies commonly seen in the mixed flora isolated from respiratory sites. This advantage justifies the inclusion of anaerobic culture when attempting to isolate Str. pneumoniae from clinical material.

2627|t|Effects of adrenalectomy and glucocorticoid therapy on enzyme activities in mammary and adipose tissues from lactating rats.
2627|a|Several mammary and adipose enzymes were measured in normal, adrenal-ectomized, adrenalectomized cortisol-treated, and intake-restricted lactating rats. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, lipoprotein lipase, and triglyceride synthetase complex activities in mammary tissue were unchanged by intake restriction, decreased by adrenalectomy, and increased by glucocorticoid-replacement therapy. Malic dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and lipoprotein lipase activities in adipose were unchanged after adrenalectomy.

2640|t|Rheological studies of Hb SS blood: influence of hematocrit, hypertonicity, separation of cells, deoxygenation, and mixture with normal cells.
2640|a|Studies of the rheological properties of Hb SS blood indicate that the marked increase in viscosity with deoxygenation is primarily due to cell-cell interaction of cells which were not permanently deformed. The permanently deformed cells, the bottom fraction of cells separated by centrifugation, show only a fraction of the increase in viscosity compared to top cells, when each was deoxygenated. Top cells showed a greater degree of morphologic change with deoxygenation compared to bottom cells. The viscosity of deoxygenated Hb SS blood was disproportionately reduced by the addition of compatible deoxygenated Hb AA cells. A mixture of 1/4 Hb AA cells and 3/4 Hb SS cells reduced the viscosity of deoxygenated Hb SS blood 50 per cent. Studies of Hb SS cells in hypertonic media indicate that hypertonicity per se does not cause sickling. Normal and Hb SS erythrocytes both show identical changes in rheological properties when suspended in hypertonic serum. However, changes in oxygen saturation due to a decrease in intracellular pH with certain hypertonic media may lead to sickling when Hb SS blood is at intermediate PO2 levels. The addition of x-ray contrast material to blood results in the changes due to hypertonicity but does not cause sickling of Hb SS cells. The contrast material lowers the pH of the media and raises intracellular pH.

2961|t|Distribution of prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductase and NAD+-dependent and NADP+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the renal cortex and medulla of various species.
2961|a|Regional distributions of PGE 9-ketoreductase and 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase were examined in the cytoplasmic fractions from the kidneys of seven species. All species contained an NADPH-dependent reductase, as well as NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases in both cortex and medulla. A previously unrecognized cytoplasmic NADH-dependent PGE 9-ketoreductase was also detected in the cortex and medulla of rat and bovine kidney. Total NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity was about equally distributed between the two renal regions of monkey, dog, rat, and swine. Bovine, rabbit, and cat had greater cortical than medullary dehydrogenase activity with ratios of 3, 5, and 10 respectively. The activities of NAD+- and NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase varied among the renal tissues.

3023|t|[Changes in oxidative systems of liver microsomes in rats following a single administration of phenobarbital and morphine].
3023|a|During the first three hours after a single administration of phenobarbital or morphine into rats a marked increase was observed in the activity and content of the respiratory chain components responsible for the oxidation of NAD-H2 and NADP-H2 in liver microsomes. This activation of oxidative enzymes correlated with the disappearance of hypnotic and analgetic effects of the narcotics. The phase following the normalization of oxydative systems was characterized by the increase of microsomal enzymes level. This is related to their specific induction only by phenobarbital.

3025|t|[Isolation and properties of 2 kallikreins from human saliva].
3025|a|Two kallikreins (K-I and K-II) were purified from mixed, parotid and submandibular human saliva. The kallikreins were separated by chromatography on CM-cellulose. The pH optima of activity were at pH 9.3 and pH 9.6-9.8; Km for BAEE was 1.10-3M and 4.10-3M, respectively. The esterase activity of K-I and K-II was inhibited by trasylol-like inhibitors, while the plant and synthetic inhibitors of trypsin were uneffective. In dog, rabbit and rat the hypotensive effect of K-II and its action upon the permeability of rabbit skin was 4-5 fold higher than the effects of K-I. Ki and K-II did not alter the arterial blood pressure in guinea pig.

3077|t|[Acetyl-CoA-synthetase activity of pigmented staphylococci].
3077|a|In 19 strains of staphylococci a study was made of the activity of acetyl-CoA-synthetase reaction. All the strains possessed an active enzymatic system transforming the acetate into an active form. The activity of acetyl-CoA-synthetase proved to be much greater in the pigmented staphyloccus strains than in the nonpigmented ones. It is supposed that there existed an association between the acetyl-CoA-synthetase and the biogenesis of carotinoid pigments in Staph. aureus.

3089|t|Survival of anaerobic bacteria during transportation. 1. Experimental investigations on the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air by flushing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
3089|a|The effect of evacuation of atmospheric air during transportation on recovery of anaerobic bacteria was investigated. Evacuation of atmospheric air from glass tubes by flushing with pure carbon dioxide lowered the content of oxygen to about 0.4 per cent. Three B. fragilis strains and one strain of Fusobacterium mortiferum and of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were investigated. Bacterial recovery was determined one hour and 24 hours after evacuation of atmospheric air by pure carbon dioxide and pure nitrogen, was compared to bacterial recovery from samples transported with free access to atmospheric air. Evacuation by pure carbon dioxide significantly improved the recovery of one B. fragilis strain after 24 hours of transportation and significantly impaired the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after one hour of transportation, while evacuation by pure nitrogen significantly improved the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after 24 hours of transportation. In all other cases, however, no statistically significant effect on bacterial recovery was found.

3114|t|Effect of acid lumen pH on potassium transport in renal cortical collecting tubules.
3114|a|In order to determine the effect of acid lumen pH on renal tubular potassium transport, cortical collecting tubules were dissected from rabbit kidneys and perfused in vitro. When the pH of the perfusate was lowered from 7.4 to 6.8, potassium secretion into the tubule lumen decreased by an average of 47%. The transepithelial voltage increased from a mean value of -32 mV (lumen negative) at pH 7.4 to -51 mV at PH 6.8. Net sodium absorption from the tubule lumen was essentially unchanged (5% mean decrease). Transepithelial voltage and potassium secretion returned to control values when the pH of the perfusate was raised to 7.4. Alterations in pH of the bath had no comparable effect on the transepithelial voltage, whether the bath pH was increased or decreased. We conclude that a decrease in the pH of the tubule fluid of itself inhibits active potassium secretion in this tubule segment, providing an additional explanation for the decrease in potassium excretion found in acidosis. The negative voltage (presumably caused by sodium absorption out of the lumen) is increased under these conditions, possibly because of reduction of a smaller counterbalancing positive voltage caused by potassium secretion into the lumen.

3160|t|Interaction of thermostable direct hemolysin of Vibrio parahaemolyticus with human erythrocytes.
3160|a|The interaction between thermostable direct hemolysin produced by Vibrio parahaemolyticus WP-1 and human erythrocytes was studied. The lysis of human erythrocytes by the hemolysin was dependent of temperature and no hemolysis occurred at low temperature (0-4 C), but the hemolysin was adsorbed on human erythrocytes even at low temperature. No hemolysis was observed when antihemolysin antiserum was mixed with the hemolysin and human erythrocytes at zero time. On the other hand, lysis of the cells by hemolysin was not completely inhibited when the antiserum was added during the lag time and the inhibitory effect decreased with delay in the time of addition of antiserum. The inhibitory effect of the antiserum decreased with increase in the incubation temperature, increase in the concentration of divalent cations, and decrease in pH. These results suggest that lysis of human erythrocytes by the hemolysin is at least a two-step process consisting of adsorption of the hemolysin to human erythrocytes and the step(s) following adsorption.

3188|t|[Influence of ethanol on the in vitro and in vivo drug release from some sustained release tablets (author's transl)].
3188|a|The in vitro and in vivo liberation of acetylsalicylic acid from sustained release tablets in presence of ethanol is described. Simultaneous uptake of 120 ml commercial brandy resulted in a faster release of the active substance from the tablets prepared with Eudragit ret-l (PM), as has been proved by urinary excretion data. These results were supported by experiments with a pH-endoaradio transmitter and by radiography.

3195|t|The effect of pH upon human transferrin: selective labelling of the two iron-binding sites.
3195|a|The influence of pH changes upon the iron-binding properties of transferrin was investigated in the absence of chelating agents. The effects were demonstrated by spectrophotometry, gel filtration, and by studies of the intermolecular transfer of 59Fe from transferrin to conalbumin. At pH values below 6.7, diferric transferrin readily loses iron. The monoferric molecule, which is relatively resistant to acid dissociation, is preferentially formed. A temporary reduction of pH provides a simple method for selectively attaching iron to one metal-binding site, and allows double isotopic labelling of the transferrin molecule. This technique may permit further investigation of the physiological properties of the two iron-binding sites.

3207|t|Enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions with the flavin analogues 5-deazariboflavin, 5-deazariboflavin 5'-phosphte, and 5-deazariboflavin 5'-diphosphate, 5' leads to 5'-adenosine ester.
3207|a|The ability of 5-deazaisoalloxazines to substitute for the isoalloxazine (flavin) coenzyme has been examined with several flavoenzymes. Without exception, the deazaflavin is recognized at the active site and undergoes a redox change in the presence of the specific enzyme substrate. Thus, deazariboflavin is reduced catalytically by NADH in the presence of the Beneckea harveyi NAD(P)H:(flavin) oxidoreductase, the reaction proceeding to an equilibrium with an equilibrium constant near unity. This implies an E0 of -0.310 V for the deazariboflavindihydrodeazariboflavin couple, much lower than that for isoalloxazines. With this enzyme, both riboflavin and deazariboflavin show the same stereospecificity with respect to the pyridine nucleotide, and despite a large difference in Vmax for the two, both have the same rate-determining step (hydrogen transfer). Direct transfer of the hydrogen is seen between the nicotinamide and deazariboflavin in both reaction directions. DeazaFMN reconstituted yeast NADPH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase (Old Yellow Enzyme), and deazaFAD reconstituted D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase and Aspergillus niger D-glucose O2 oxidoreductase are all reduced by substrate at approximately 10(-5) the rate of holoenzyme; none are reoxidized by oxygen or any of the tested artificial electron acceptors, though deazaFADH-bound to D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase is rapidly oxidized by the imino acid product. Direct hydrogen transfer from substrate to deazaflavin has been demonstrated for both deazaFAD-reconstituted oxidases. These data implicate deazaflavins as a unique probe of flavin catalysis, in that any mechanism for the flavin catalysis must account for the deazaflavin reactivity as well.

3215|t|Kinetics of reaction of anions with methemerythrin derivatives.
3215|a|The kinetics of anation of methemerythrin over a wide range of pH and concentration of anions have been studied at 25 degrees C. The azide and thiocyanate ions have been most intensively investigated but experiments with fluoride and chloride are also reported. The replacement of anion in methemerythrin-anionic adducts by other anions has also been studied. Except for replacement of met-fluoride by azide, all replacements can be explained by a dissociative mechanism via the aquated species. Anations are second-order and an associative mechanism is preferred. The second-order rate constant decreases with increasing anion concentrations (from 20 muM to 20 mM). This is attributed to the effect of a secondary anion binding site. The behavior of octameric and monomeric forms of the protein toward thiocyanate is identical. A comparison of results with simple Fe(III) complexes and certain metalloproteins is made.

3223|t|A non-equilibrium thermodynamics analysis of active transport within the framework of the chemiosotic theory.
3223|a|The proton circuit devised by Mitchell in the chemiosmotic theory was subjected to analysis using the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics. The phenomenological coefficients and the degree of coupling relating co-permeant flows were derived from anion/H+, substrate/H+, cation/H+ and anion/anion biporter models. Linearity and equality of the cross-coefficients in Onsager relations were always satisfied. Macroscopic flows leading to charges splitting, such as oxido-reduction, hydro-dehydratation and transhydrogenase, are driven by a composite thermodynamic force which includes the proton-motive component. Multiple coupling occurs in the circuit when it is assumed that the net inward flux of protons becomes zero, i.e. when the circulation of protons reaches a stationary state. Under these conditions, oxidative phosphorylation, ATPase- or respiration-linked transhydrogenase and uptake of anion or cation against their electrochemical gradient may be predicted, in agreement with known experimental evidence.

3225|t|Effects of pH during recombination of human erythrocyte membrane apoprotein and lipid.
3225|a|The recombinates from human red cell membrane proteins and lipids resulting from dialysis of the components in 2-chloroethanol against aqueous buffers from pH2-12 have been studied by density gradient centrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Between pH 4 and 10 most of the proteins were found in the recombinates whereas below pH 4 and above pH 10 only part of them were recovered in the lipoprotein band after density gradient centrifugation. At low pH, increasing incorporation of the "major glycoprotein" into the recombinates was detected by gel electrophoresis and in parallel increasing amounts of particles were found in the freeze-fracture membrane faces. The necessity of working at low pH values from pH 2-4, however, and a critical evaluation of all the data presently available leads to the conclusion that the 2-choloroethanol technique is not adequate for recombination studies tending to membrane reconsitution.

3249|t|Effects of chronic nicotine administration on the denervated rat adrenal medulla.
3249|a|1 The effects of chronic nicotine administration (1 or 10 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily) were studied in intact and denervated rat adrenal glands to determine the relative roles of central input and direct actions on catecholamines. 2 Catecholamine depletion was obtained in the intact glands from 1-7 days of treatment with 10 mg/kg, with recovery by 14 days of treatment; catecholamines were not decreased in denervated adrenal glands. 3 Catecholamine depletion was accompanied by a decline in functional storage vesicles (determined by [3H]-adrenaline uptake per gland) in the intact side, while no change was seen in the denervated side; the proportion of newly synthesized vesicles increased markedly during 1-7 days of treatment with 10 mg/kg in the intact side, while a much smaller increase of shorter duration was seen in the denervated adrenal gland. 4 Chronic nicotine administration at either dose level induced tyrosine hydroxylase in both intact and denervated glands, but the increase occurred more slowly in the denervated glands. 5 Dopamine beta-hydroxylase levels increased similarly in both sides during treatment with nicotine (10 mg/kg). 6 These studies suggest that although long-term adrenal denervation eliminates the catecholamine depletion caused by chronic administration of nicotine, the mechanisms for induction of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes are still capable of responding to the drug.

3279|t|Double-blind evaluation of oral L-prolyl-Lleucyl-glycine amide in Parkinson's disease.
3279|a|A 4-month double-blind study comparing the effect of increasing oral doses (up to 1.0 g daily) of synthetic L-proyl-L-leucyl-glycine amide (PLG) and placebo in 20 parkinsonian patients showed no significant improvement in objective scores of functional disability. However, important trends and some significant results were observed with the lower doses of PLG. These essentially negative results may be attributed to poor intestinal absorption of the compound, a short biologic half-life in the blood, or administration of oral doses that were much higher than required, or a combination of factors. In further studies with this peptide, which are encouraged, the intravenous route should be used until the question of intestinal absorption is resolved.

3286|t|Inhibition of nadph-driven microsomal lipid peroxidation by cytosol factor(s). Effect of a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet.
3286|a|Male Swiss mice were given free access to a fat-free, high carbohydrate diet. The liver cytosol fraction from these mice contained a heat-sensitive factor that markedly inhibited microsomal, ferric pyrophosphate stimulated, NADPH-driven lipid peroxidation. The diet-induced factor was apparently incorporated into the microsomes after 12 days of continuous feeding, since lipid peroxidation by these microsomes was strongly diminished. The factor disappeared from the cytosol after 24 h of fasting and reappeared after refeeding the mice with the fat-free, high carbohydrate diet.

3403|t|Physiological disposition and metabolism of N-t-butylarterenol and its di-p-toluate ester (bitolterol) in the rat.
3403|a|The metabolism and disposition of the bronchodilator, N-t-butylarterenol (tBA) and its di-p-toluate ester (bitolterol) were compared in the rat. Radioactivity was preferentially retained in lungs of rats compared with heart and blood after iv medication with tritium-labeled bitolterol, but was not retained in tissues after iv medication with [3H]tBA. After oral and iv medication with [3H]bitolterol, fecal radioactivity accounted for 24% of the dose and 65 and 79% of the radioactivity, respectively, was excreted in urine (0-72 hr). In comparison, urine radioactivity after oral and iv medication with [3H]tBA was 43 and 83% of the dose, respectively, and fecal radioactivity accounted for 43 or 23% of the dose, respectively (0-72 hr). Bitolterol was hydrolyzed in vitro to tBA by esterases found in various tissues including small intestine, liver, and plasma. Moreover, tBA was a substrate for catecholamine O-methyltransferase but not for monoamine oxidase. Similar metabolites were observed in urine samples of rats given either [3H]tBA or [3H]bitolterol. Urine metabolites were identified as free and conjugated forms of both tBA and 3-O-methyl-tBA.

3482|t|Effects of aminophylline, imidazole and indomethacin on spontaneous and prostaglandin induced ovarian contractions in vitro.
3482|a|Imidazole, acetylcholine, phenylephrine prostaglandin F2alpha, and methyl prostaglandin F2alpha increased the contractility of guinea pig and human ovaries in vitro. This effect was suppressed by aminophylline. Indomethacin inhibited ovarian contractions. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was reversed by prostaglandin F2alpha or by its methyl derivative. Prostaglandin E2 decreased the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous and prostaglandin F2alpha induced contractions of guinea pig ovaries in vitro. The study shows that compounds which interfere with cyclic AMP and prostaglandin metabolism affect ovarian contractility in vitro.   PIP: A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the role of PGs (prostaglandins) and cyclic AMP in the regulation of the contractility and pharmacologic reactivity of guinea pig and human ovaries in vitro. Ovarian contractility results with the various substances tested are graphed. Imidazole, acetylcholine, phenylephrine PGF2alpha, and methyl PGF2alpha increased ovarian contractility of guinea pig and human ovaries in vitro. Aminophylline suppressed this effect. Indomethacin inhibited ovarian contractions. PGF2alpha and its methyl derivative reversed this inhibitory effect of indomethacin. PGE2 decreased the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous and PGF2alpha-induced contractions. The effect of certain of the substances was dose-dependent. The study results show that aminophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is a potent relaxant of guinea pig ovary contraction in vitro. This inhibitory effect is probably caused by the accumulation of cyclic AMP. The ovarian activation caused by imidazole, on the other hand, is probably caused from an increased rate of cyclic AMP destruction. Thus, compounds interfering with cyclic AMP and PG metabolism effect ovarian contractility in vitro.

3520|t|Identification and characterization of a bile acid receptor in isolated liver surface membranes.
3520|a|It is generally assumed that hepatic transport of bile acids is a carrier-mediated process. However, the basic mechanisms by which these organic anions are translocated across the liver cell surface membrane are not well understood. Since carrier-mediated transport involved binding of the transported molecule to specific receptor sites, we have investigated the possibility that bile acid receptors are present in liver surface membranes. Isolated liver surface membranes were incubated at 4 degrees C with [14C]cholic acid and [14C]taurocholic acid, and membrane-boudn bile acid was separated from free by a rapid ultrafiltration technique through glass-fiber filters. Specific bile acid binding is rapid and reversible and represents approximately 80% of the total bile acid bound to liver surface membranes. Taurocholic acid binding is independent of the medium pH, while cholic acid binding demonstrates an optimum at pH 6.0. Analysis of equilibrium data for both cholic and taurocholic acid binding indicates that specific binding is saturable and consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while nonspecific binding is nonsaturable. Apparent maximal binding capacity and dissociation constant values indicate a large capacity system of receptors that have an affinity for bile acids comparable to that of the hepatic transport mechanism. Scatchard analysis of the saturation kinetics as well as inhibition studies suggest that bile acids bind to a single and noninteracting class of anion that competes with bile acids for hepatic uptake, also inhibits cholic acid binding. In contrast, no inhibition was demonstrated with indocyanine green and probenecid. Specific bile acid binding is enriched and primarily located in liver surface membranes and found only in tissues involved in bile acid transport. Specific bile acid binding is independnet of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and does not require metabolic energy. In addition, thiol groups and disulfide are not required for activity at the binding site. However, specific bile acid binding is markedly decreased by low concentrations of proteolytic enzymes and is also decreased by the action of neuraminidase and phospholipases A and C. These results are consistent with the existence of a homogeneous bile acid receptor protein in liver surface membranes. The primary surface membrane location of this receptor, its binding properties, and its ligand specificity suggest that bile acid binding to this receptor may represent the initial interaction in bile acid transport across liver surface membranes.

3617|t|Prolactin stimulation test with perphenazine: an evaluation of plasma prolactin levels and pituitary secretory activity in the rat.
3617|a|Many investigations of the regulation of prolactin synthesis and release are based on single plasma prolactin determinations. The purpose of the present experiment was to ascertain whether groups of rats (i.e. young or adult, male or female animals, being either intact, gonadectomized or gonadectomized and treated with oestrone), differing in age and/or endocrine status, will react to a single dose of perphenazine by an acute release of pituitary prolactin in proportion to their initial plasma prolactin levels. No consistent relation existed between the classification of the twelve groups of rats into three categories of basal plasma prolactin levels (i.e. less than 20, 25-50, greater than 125 ng/ml) and their response to perphenazine. Even though all groups showed a highly significant increase of plasma prolactin levels the magnitude of the maximum prolactin response at 30 min varied greatly within the groups of one category and thus was not related to the initial prolactin levels. The effect of 14 days of oestrone treatment in increasing plasma prolactin levels in gonadectomized animals was greatest in young and adult male rats, less in young females and not significant in adult females. The results obtained after perphenazine treatment in the latter group made it clear that the effect of oestrogen treatment on prolactin release can be completely blocked by increasing synthesis and/or release of the prolactin-release inhibiting factor (PIF). Since perphenazine induces decrease of pituitary prolactin and a concomitant increase of plasma prolactin levels through lowered PIF-action, the positive effect of oestrogens on prolactin release (as observed in gonadectomized male and young female rats) apparently is caused by a different mode of action. The implications of these findings for the regulation of prolactin release, as affected by the endocrine status of the rat, is discussed. Moreover, comparison of prolactin lost from the pituitary and gained in the circulation of the experimental animals, with amounts of prolactin that were observed to disappear from plasma during the experiment, provided suggestive evidence that the capacity to synthesize and/or eliminate prolactin, after a sudden provoked release of the hormone, differed among the groups. The rates of synthesis by the pituitary, of release from the pituitary into the circulation as well as of elimination of the hormone from the circulation (equally involved in determing actual plasma levels) are thought, therefore, to be far more important for the elucidation of prolactin regulation than single plasma prolactin determinations.

3622|t|Analysis of acetate non-utilizing (acu) mutants in Aspergillus nidulans.
3622|a|Genetic analysis of 119 acetate non-utilizing (acu) mutants in Aspergillus nidulans revealed ten new loci affecting acetate metabolism in addition to the three previously recognized on the basis of resistance to fluoroacetate and acetate non-utilization. The enzyme lesions associated with mutations at seven of the acu loci are described. These are: facA (= acuA), acetyl-CoA synthase; acuD, isocitrate lyase; acuE, malate synthase; acuF, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; acuG, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase; acuK and acuM, malic enzyme. The acu loci have been mapped and are widely distributed over the genome of A. nidulans. Close linkage has only been found between acuA and acuD (less than 1% recombination). There is no evidence for any pleiotropic mutation in that region affecting the expression of both these genes. Poor induction of the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase in mutants lacking acetyl-CoA synthase, and also in the other two classes of fluoroacetate-resistant mutants, indicates that the inducer, acetate, may be metabolized to a true metabolic inducer, perhaps acetyl-CoA, to effect formation of the enzymes. There is no evidence of any other class of pleiotropic recessive acu mutations affecting the expression of the acuD and acuE genes, which are therefore thought to be subject to negative rather than positive control.

3640|t|Neurogenic influences of bilateral adrenalectomy on monoamine oxidase.
3640|a|Bilateral adrenalectomy (10 days) increased the monoamine oxidase activity of the rat heart, vas deferens, spleen, superior cervical ganglion, and hypothalamus but not that of the rest of the brain, kidney, and liver. Experiments were made to determine whether the increased activity was due to neurogenic influences and whether the enhanced activity of monoamine oxidase was intra- or extraneuronally located. Ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine failed to alter the rise in cardiac monoamine oxidase. Likewise, superior cervical ganglion monoamine oxidase was unaffected by surgical denervation. 6-Hydroxydopamine abolished the increase in monoamine oxidase activity of the vas deferens, spleen, and superior cervical ganglion but failed to alter that of the kidney, hypothalamus, and the rest of the brain. Cardiac monoamine oxidase was reduced markedly by 6-hydroxydopamine, but the remaining activity was still significantly elevated over the respective control values. The data suggest that the increase in organ monoamine oxidase is predominantly of neuronal origin and that this increase is not due to transsynaptic induction.

3645|t|Two components of the calcium current in the egg cell membrane of the tunicate.
3645|a|The Ca current of the egg cell membrane of a certain tunicate, Halocynthia roretzi Drasche, was studied by the voltage-clamp technique. 2. The Ca current in the standard artificial sea water (ASW) was produced at the critical membrane potential of -10 mV after inactivating the Na current by conditioning depolarization, -30 to -15 mV. The Ca current was abolished by replacing Ca in ASW with Mg2+ or Mn2+. The Ca current was not significantly influenced by replacing Na in ASW with choline or Cs. 3. The relation of Ca current to the external Ca concentration was a monotonously increasing function, but was not linear. The current tended to saturate above 50 mM-Ca. In 100 mM-Ca ASW, the maximum peak inward current of Ca ranged from 1 to 7 X 10(-9) A. 4. The kinetics of Ca current was accurately analysed because of the small contribution of K outward current and was found to be relatively slow in comparison with the Na current. The peak time and the half-decay time of the maximum Ca current at about 25 mV were about 25 and 100 msec respectively in 100 mM-Ca ASW at 15 degrees C. 5. Addition of 20 mM-Co2+ to 100 mM-Ca ASW reduced Ca current to one fourth and 1 mM-La3+ to 100 mM-Ca ASW abolished the current. 6. Sr and Ba could substitute for Ca in Ca channels. The selectivity ratios for the 'Ca channels's were Ca (1-00):Sr(1-17):Ba(0-71) at a potential level of +40 mV. The Ca current in the egg cell membrane appeared to be essentially the same as the Ca current in the common excitable membranes, such as the crustacean muscle fibre. 7. The polyvalent cations including Ca ion and monovalent H+ ion showed the stabilizing effect upon both Na and Ca currents, by shifting V-I relations along the voltage axis. From the prediction of a theory of the diffuse double layer, the shift in the V-I relation induced by those cations should be directly related to their binding powers to the membrane. Thus, the sequence of the binding powers was inferred as H+ greater than La3+ greater than Co2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ larger than or equal to Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. 9. In Na-free ASW, such as isotonic Ca ASW, Ca current was composed of two components. The one component was the Ca current described in 1 to 6. The other was also dependent upon the external Ca concentration, but showed the more negative critical membrane potential and the faster kinetics. It was concluded that this component should be the Ca current through Na channels. 10. The selectivity among Ca, Sr and Ba for 'Ca' current through 'Na channels' was significantly different from that of 'Ca' current through 'Ca channels', being Ca greater than Sr larger than or equal to Ba = 0.

3665|t|Isoaccepting species of serine tRNA coded by bacteriophage T5sto.
3665|a|By aminoacyl-tRNA-DNA hybridization and chromatographic analysis, evidence was provided that the bacteriophage T5stO codes for two tRNAser species. Trinucleotide- or polynucleotide-stimulated binding experiments assigned the codons UCC or UCU to these two tRNAser species. They also suggested that the synthesis of these two tRNAser species does not modify the reading capacity for codons less used in Escherichia coli F and corresponds to a different situation compared with the T4-coded tRNA's.

3720|t|[Relevance of biochemistry in diagnosis and development of alcoholic liver disease (author's transl)].
3720|a|In a group of 205 patients with alcoholic diseases of liver the diagnostic relevance of biochemical tests (GOT, GPT, AP, GGTP, BSP) was reconsidered with discriminatory process (separation of diagnosis). The group contained 16 patients with nutritional-caused and 41 cases with alcoholic-caused fatty-infiltration of liver. 148 patients showed a toxic chronic liver disease; 52 a chronic hepatitis and 96 cirrhosis of liver. Laparoscopy and morphology guaranteed the clinical diagnosis and therefore the accuracy of biochemistry in separation of diagnosis was given. The biochemical tests were not able to offer a separation of fatty-infiltration with reference to cause, changes of the process in toxic hepatitis and cirrhosis were announced. Intersection in several cases was noticed and biochemical tests were not able to substitute endoscopy and morphology for clinical and diagnostic use in all cases. In every regard the enzyme-tests,--above mentioned--, and determination of sulfobromthalein are aptly to development of diseases and deficiency of alcohol.

3780|t|Control of adenylate cyclase from secretory vesicle membranes by beta-adrenergic agents and nerve growth factor.
3780|a|Adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] activity of purified secretory vesicle membranes from the adrenal medulla is inhibited by I-isoproterenol and I-epinephrine, as well as by nerve growth factor (NGF). The effect of these agents was found to be dose-dependent and, in the case of the catecholamines, saturable. NGF was active at concentrations as low as 10(-8) M. Oxidized NGF was only minimally active, and insulin was completely inactive. Neither dopamine nor phenylephrine had activity. Inhibition of cyclase by either isoproterenol or epinephrine was blocked by I-propranolol, a specific beta-antagonist, but propranolol by itself had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. The data indicate that the secretory vesicle membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors coupled to the adenylate cyclase. Propranolol was also found to block the NGF-induced inhibition of cyclase. We conclude that the granule membrane has beta-adrenergic receptors as well as NGF-reactive sites, and that the two may be functionally linked.

3898|t|[Immunosuppressive treatment in autoimmune vasculities].
3898|a|From own experiences the observations of 3 patients were reported who were immunosuppressively treated with purine antagonists (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine). Hereby in a severe allergic vasculitis in a 22-year-old patient and in a granulomatous arteritis during Wegener's granulomatosis in a 51-year-old patient remissions for more than 1 and 7 years, respectively, could be achieved under immunosuppressive long-term therapy. In the case of a periarteriitis nodosa death took place 2 months after administration of 6-mercaptopurine.

3940|t|Alanine formation and alanine aminotransferase activity in the nerve tissue with proliferating macroglia.
3940|a|In the nerve tissue with proliferating macroglia cells were observed a lowered oxygen consumption, an increased aerobic glycolysis and alanine formation and a higher alanine aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase activity than in the control tissue in the homogenates and in the cell sap fraction. The substrate saturation curves, apparent Km and pH optimum values in the tissue with proliferating macroglia and in the control did not differ from one another. The authors assume that a higher alanine aminotransferase activity in the tissue with macroglia proliferation can reflect either a higher synthesis of the enzyme in the altered tissue, or a predominance of glial elements in the altered tissue possessing a higher alanine aminotransferase activity than the nerve cells.

3996|t|Acid-base values of standardbred horses recovering from strenuous exercise.
3996|a|Blood gases, lactic acid concentrations, and pH were measured in arterial and mixed venous blood in moderately conditioned Standardbred horses after a standardized exercise load of 1.6 km in 2 minutes, 40 seconds. Samples were obtained at rest, immediately after exercise, and at 3, 6, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after exercise. Arterial oxygen tension and mixed venous oxygen tension increased after exercise, reaching peak values at 6 minutes. Arterial oxygen tension returned to the resting (preexercise) value by 15 minutes, and mixed venous oxygen tension by 30 minutes. Arterial carbon dioxide tension decreased immediately after exercise, reaching its lowest value at 6 minutes, and returned to resting value by 30 minutes. Mixed venous carbon dioxide tension reached its highest value immediately after exercise, then decreased to less than the resting value, reaching its lowest value by 15 minutes, and returned to normal by 60 minutes. Lactic acid concentration increased immediately after exercise, reaching its highest value at 6 minutes, and returned toward normal by 60 minutes. Arterial pH decreased immediately after exercise, reaching its lowest value at 6 minutes, and returned to normal by 60 minutes. Mixed venous pH reached its lowest value immediately after exercise, then began to increase, and returned to normal by 60 minutes. The decrease in mixed venous pH was more pronounced than that in arterial blood since, in addition to the increase in lartic acid, there was a considerable increase in mixed venous carbon dioxide tension.

4037|t|Increased mucociliary transport by adrenergic stimulation.
4037|a|Tracheobronchial clearance of inhaled 6mum Teflon particles (density 2 gm/cu cm) tagged with technetium 99m was studied in healthy subjects by external measurement of the radioactivity in the lungs for two hours. Clearance, salivary secretion, blood pressure, and heart rate were determined in eight subjects after double-blind, subcutaneous administration of 0.25 mg terbutaline sulfate, a beta-adrenoceptor stimulating compound and vehicle, respectively, in a crossover study. Terbutaline produced a marked increase in clearance and a slight increase in heart rate, but had no important effect on salivary secretion or blood pressure. The result indicates that the blood concentrations of catecholamines might be of importance for the regulation of the mucociliary transport rate.

4040|t|Resin hemoperfusion for acute drug intoxication.
4040|a|Eight patients with drug intoxication were hemoperfused on ten occasions at a blood-flow rate of 300 ml/min with a 650gm column of Amberlite XAD-4 resin, which is a macroreticular resin with a specific adsorptive attraction for lipid-soluble organic molecules. Column clearances of glutethimide and a variety of barbiturates ranged from 207 to 300 ml/min for treatment sessions extending from 2 1/2 to ten hours. After ingestion of 75 gm of glutethimide, one patient received hemoperfusion on three successive days for nine, ten, and eight hours, respectively. She recovered after the column removed over 30 gm of drug. The patients demonstrated dramatic clinical responses with no evidence of meaningful toxic reactions. Column hemoperfusion with Amberlite XAD-4 resin was simpler and more effective than any known method of removing barbiturates and glutethimide from the blood of patients with drug overdoses.

4080|t|Effects of the cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent metoprolol in angina pectoris. Subacute study with exercise tests.
4080|a|The effect of a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, metoprolol, on symptoms and exercise tolerance was studied in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Metroprolol was compared with placebo at two dose levels (20 mg t.d.s. and 50 mg t.d.s.) in a double-blind trial in 14 patients. Compared with placebo, metroprolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise, and consequently a reduction of the rate-pressure product. The reduction was greater with 50 mg t.d.s. than with 20 mg t.d.s. The exercise tolerance measured as total work increased significantly by 21 per cent during treatment with metroprolol 20 mg t.d.s., and by 17 per cent during treatment with 50 mg t.d.s. There was a reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption, and subjective improvement of angina pectoris at both dose levels of metroprolol. No signs of cardiac failure appeared during any of the four treatment periods. Heart volume showed no significant change. Unwanted effects were of the same frequency and severity during treatment with metroprolol at both dose levels as with placebo.

4083|t|The availability of folates in man: effect of orange juice supplement on intestinal conjugase.
4083|a|The mechanisms of the low availability of endogenous folates in orange juice and the inhibitory effects on the availability of pteroylheptaglutamate (PteGlu7) caused by orange juice supplements were investigated in man by the use of simulated orange juice (containing the principal components: citric acid, malic acid, etc.) with several different pHs. The endogenous folates in orange juice were identified as mainly 5-methyl reduced derivatives of pteroylpolyglutamates (40-45% pentaglutamate, 10-15% tetraglutamate, 30-40% monoglutamate, and the rest were tri-and diglutamates). The availability of PteGlu7 is decreased to 54% by supplementation with 600 g concentrated orange juice (pH 3.7) and to 39% and 66% by the supplement of 24 g and 12 g citric acid (pH 3.7), respectively. Neutralization of 12 g citric acid to pH 6.4 largely reverses the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, the availability of pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu) is not influenced by a supplement of orange juice or citric acid. The results suggest that the low availability of PteGlu7 is due to the inhibition of intestinal conjugase caused by the low pH. These observations suggest that pH of foodstuffs may be an important factor in the absorption of polyglutamate forms of folate.

4095|t|The esterification of dolichol by rat liver microsomes.
4095|a|The incubation of 1-[3H)dolichols with cell-free preparations from various rat tissues resulted in the formation of a labeled material which possessed the characteristics of synthetic dolichol palmitate. Rat liver microsomes were found to be a good source of the acyltransferase activity, and the properties of the reaction were investigated using microsomal preparations. The reaction did not require ATP, CoA, or Mg2+ and was stimulated by the addition of phosphatidylcholine. The esterification of dolichol appears to be similar to the esterification of retinol. The fact that the esterification of dolichol is not depressed even in the presence of a several-fold excess of retinol is evidence that the two reactions are catalyzed by different enzymes.

4109|t|Binding of norgestrel to human plasma proteins.
4109|a|Binding of [14, 15-3H](+/-)-norgestrel to human plasma proteins has been investigated. Norgestrel showed greater affinity to plasma than to human serum albumin indicating specific norgestrel binding protein(s) in the plasma. alpha1-acid glycoprotein showed high affinity for norgestrel when compared with human serum albumin. The binding protein was eluted at pH 5.8 by step by step elution on a DEAE-cellulose column. Norgestrel binding to plasma proteins was not affected at 60 degrees C. The optimal binding occurred between pH 7 and 8. Ligand specificity of the binding protein revealed that progesterone was able to compete for the norgestrel binding sites, whereas corticosterone, testosterone, oestradiol, and norethindrone acetate did not show much competition. The molecular weight of the binding protein was found to be approximately 43 000. Sucrose density gradient analysis indicated that norgestrel bound to a macromolecular component of sedimentation coefficient 2.9 S. The association constant (Kass) and dissociation constant (Kdiss) of norgestrel-binding plasma protein was found to be 1.4-10(6) M-1 and 0.7-10(-6) M respectively. The number of binding sites was 0.5-10(-9) mol/mg protein. Norgestrel-binding protein in the plasma appeared to be a protein different from human serum albumin, corticosteroid-binding globulin and sex-steroid-binding protein. This binding protein showed some similarities to alpha1-acid glycoprotein.

4115|t|Activation of murine lymphocytes by cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate: specificity and role in mitogen activity.
4115|a|Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) stimulates nucleic acid synthesis in lymphocytes, and has been implicated as the intracellular effector of the actions of mitogenic agents on these cells. In the present study, we examined the specificity of the mitogenic activity of cyclic GMP and of its 8-bromo (Br) derivatives, and the effects of the T cell mitogens, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and staphylococcal entertoxin B (SEB) on the cyclic GMP content and guanylate cyclase activity of mouse splenic lymphocytes. Cyclic GMP and guanosine modestly increased the incorporation of [3H] thymidine into DNA by cultured lymphocytes, but were far less effective than their 8-Br-guanosine and 8-Br-5'-GMP exceeded that of 8-Br-cyclic GMP, when tested in the presence and absence of serum in the culture media. Combined addition of maximal doses of these nucleotides did not give additive stimulatory effects, suggesting an action on a common subpopulation of cells, and possibly a common mechanism. By contrast, cyclic AMP, 8-Br-cyclic AMP, 8-Br-adenosine, cholera toxin and prostaglandin E1 suppressed both basal [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulation of this parameter by T-cell mitogens and the guanine nucleotides. Rapid effects of concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, SEB, guanosine, 5'-GMP, 8-Br-guanosine, and 8-Br-5'-GMP on the cyclic GMP content of murine lymphocytes could not be demonstrated. Similarly, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and SEB failed to alter guanylate cyclase activity when added directly to cellular homogenates or pre-incubated with intact cells. Conversely, carbamylcholine rapidly increased lymphocyte cyclic GMP but was not mitogenic. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP are antagonistic in their influence on lymphocyte mitogenesis. However, they also demonstrate that related nucleotides are more potent mitogens than cyclic GMP itself and suggest that activation of murine lymphocytes by concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and SEB may not be mediated by rapid increases in cellular cyclic GMP content. Since high concentrations of exogenous cyclic GMP and related nucleotides must be used to influence DNA synthesis, the biologic significance of this effect remains uncertain.

4116|t|Characterization of protein kinases from bovine parotid glands. The effect of tolbutamide and its derivative on these partially purified enzymes.
4116|a|1. Four fractions of protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) activity (Peak IH, IIH, IIIC and IVC) have been resolved and partially purified from the 100 000 X g supernatant fraction of bovine parotid glands by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatographies. 2. The protein kinases of Peak IH and IIH were adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) -dependent and had similar enzymic properties. The enzyme activities of Peak IIIC and IVC were cyclic-AMP independent, but there were some distinct differences between their properties. The protein kinase in Peak IIIC was activated by 0.2 M NaCl or KCl and phosphorylated casein preferentially as the substrate, utilizing only ATP as a phosphate donor. On the other hand, the protein kinase in Peak IVC was inhibited by univalent salts and preferred phosvitin to casein, utilizing either ATP or GTP as a phosphate donor. 3. Tolbutamide increased the Km value for ATP and the dissociation constant for cyclic AMP, resulting in the inhibition of cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase activity in the presence of cyclic AMP. Tolbtamide and its carboxy derivative, 1-butyl-3-p-carboxyphenylsulfonylurea, exerted almost no inhibitory effect on either the cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase activities in the absence of cyclic AMP or on the cyclic-AMP independent protein kinase activities.

4127|t|Comparative kinetic studies on the L-type pyruvate kinase from rat liver and the enzyme phosphorylated by cyclic 3', 5'-AMP-stimulated protein kinase.
4127|a|The kinetics of rat liver L-type pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40), phosphorylated with cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase from the same source, and the unphosphorylated enzyme have been compared. The effects of pH and various concentrations of substrates, Mg2+, K+ and modifiers were studied. In the absence of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate at pH 7.3, the phosphorylated pyruvate kinase appeared to have a lower affinity for phosphoenolpyruvate (K0.5=0.8 mM) than the unphosphorylated enzyme (K0.5=0.3 mM). The enzyme activity vs. phosphoenolpyruvate concentration curve was more sigmoidal for the phosphorylated enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 compared to 1.6 for the unphosphorylated enzyme. Fructose 1, 6-diphosphate increased the apparent affinity of both enzyme forms for phosphoenolpyruvate. At saturating concentrations of this activator, the kinetics of both enzyme forms were transformed to approximately the same hyperbolic curve, with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 and K0.5 of about 0.04 mM for phosphoenolpyruvate. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for fructose 1, 6-diphosphate was high at 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate with a K0.5=0.06 muM for the unphosphorylated pyruvate kinase and 0.13 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. However, in the presence of 0.5 mM alanine plus 1.5 mM ATP, a higher fructose 1, 6-diphosphate concentration was needed for activation, with K0.5 of 0.4 muM for the unphosphorylated enzyme and of 1.4 muM for the phosphorylated enzyme. The results obtained strongly indicate that phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase may also inhibit the enzyme in vivo. Such an inhibition should be important during gluconeogenesis.

4143|t|Evidence against proton gradient formation being the cause of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching by N-methylphenazonium methosulfate.
4143|a|In strong illumination, 3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU)-poisoned chloroplasts exhibit a high yield of chlorophyll fluorescence while P-700 turnover, proton uptake, and phosphorylation are inhibited and a pH gradient is undectectable. When 10muM N-methylphenazonium methosulfate (PMS) is included, the fluorescence yield in light is substantially reduced, and when 100 muM ascorbate is also included, the yield is diminished approximately to the level in darkness. Only very slight increases in P-700 turnover and proton uptake (but no detectable pH gradient) accompany the fluorescence yield decline. When 10muM PMS and 15 mM ascorbate are added to poisoned chloroplasts (the oxygen concentration being greatly reduced), P-700 turnover, proton uptake, the pH gradient and phosphorylation all reach high levels. In this case, the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence is low and is the same in both light and dark. Further addition of an uncoupler eliminates proton uptake, the pH gradient and phosphorylation but does not significantly elevate the fluorescence yield. From these observations we suggest that, in DCMU-poisoned chloroplasts, the fluorescence quenching with PMS occurrs by a mechanism unrelated to the generation of a phosphyorylation potential. With chloroplasts unpoisoned by DCMU, PMS quenches fluorescence and considerably stimulates proton uptake, the pH gradient and phosphorylation. However, in this case, PMS serves to restore net electron transport.

4154|t|[Acetylcholinesterase. II. Experimental aspects of interaction with reversible effectors under conditions of high ionic strength].
4154|a|Interaction of usual effectors with acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) from bovine erythrocytes was examined under conditions of high ionic strength (gamma/2 greater than or equal to 0,1). Detailed kinetic investigation of the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase in the presence of modifiers shows that the effects produced by numerous quaternary nitrogen compounds on the enzyme can be explained on the basis of binding of the effectors to the anionic subsite of the active center. The various kinetic behaviors, that are observed, are dependent on the relative values of the deacetylation rate constant ak of the complex acetylated enzyme-modifier and of the rate constant k-2 defined by : (see article) with respect to the value of the deacetylation rate constant K of the acetylated enzyme. If a identical to [1--(k/k-2)]-1, it is shown that interaction of the enzyme with tetraethylammonium, pentamethonium, hexamethonium and gallamine ions is characterized by : a greater than a and k-2 greater than k therefore, these modifiers accelerate deacetylation. On the other hand, inhibition of acetylcholinestase by methylpyridinium, d-tubocurarine, tetra-n-propylammonium, tetra-n-butylammonium, decamethonium and succinylbischoline is consistent with one of the conditions : a less than a and k-2 greater than or equal to k or a greater than a and k-2 less than k and inhibition by tetramethylammonium, phenyltrimethylammonium, 3-hydroxyphenyl-triethylammonium, N-methylacridinium and bis (3-aminopyridinium)-1,10-decane ions agrees with one of the two previous conditions or with : (see article) consequently, the effect of these ligands on the deacetylation step is undetermined. However, the effects of choline chloride, thiazinamium methyl sulfate and thioridazine hydrochloride are not entirely consistent with this mechanism but support the existence of a functional peripheral anionic site which is distinct from the anionic subsite of the active center.

4161|t|[Characterization of some hydrolase activities in digestive juice of Achatina balteata].
4161|a|The digestive juice of Achatina balteata, a giant snail of the West African Coast catalyses the hydrolysis of several natural and synthetic compounds. Enzymatic activities on lactose, o- and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D (and alpha-L-) fucoside, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide and phenolphthalein-glucuronide have been shown to be present. The effect of pH and substrate concentration on these activities were studied. The galactosidase, glucosidase and fucosidase activities were studied with respect to temperature, heat inactivation, pH stability and incubation with trypsin. Kinetic experiments suggest the presence of several galactosidase activities. This hypothesis is confirmed by specific staining after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These activities showed a broad specificity towards galactosides and glucosides. The digestive juice showed no action on acetyl-L-tyrosine and benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl esters. However a small protease activity was observed on hemoglobine. No lipase activity was found. Sulfatase content was low compared to that of Helix pomatia.

4199|t|Resolution, specificity and transphosphorylase activity of calcifying cartilage alkaline phosphatases.
4199|a|The phosphate releasing activity from calf scapula cartilage was resolved by DEAE-cellulose chromatography into two distinct phosphatase activities. The activity eluted first from the column (phosphatase I) was active towards a variety of phosphate esters and several linear oligo phosphates including sodium pyrophosphate, while the second phosphatase activity (phosphatase II) was active only towards simple phosphate esters. Phosphatase I acted towards oligo phosphates in a stepwise fashion hydrolyzing one phosphate at a time. Both phosphatase are sialoproteins and can transfer phosphate from any of their substrates into other than water phosphate acceptor molecules such as glycerol. By several criteria, it can be concluded that the two phosphatases are different enzyme entities.

4207|t|Pulmonary edema and ascorbic acid loss.
4207|a|Loss of ascorbic acid from lung and pulmonary edema were produced in mice by intravenous injection of either adrenaline or noradrenaline (5 mumol/kg). While adrenalectomy performed before noradrenaline administration reduced the degree of pulmonary edema, a prior dose of hexamethonium accentuated this effect. Given alone, hexamethonium caused both loss of ascorbic acid and pulmonary edema. The results show that although endogenous catecholamines can potentiate the pulmonary edema produced by either adrenaline or noradrenaline, they play no specific role in the ascorbic acid loss. The evidence suggests that lung ascorbic acid levels are decreased following the development of pulmonary edema, irrespective of how it was caused.

4215|t|Effect of variou cultural conditions on the fatty acid and lipid composition of Choanephora cucurbitarum.
4215|a|The fatty acid composition of the total and polar lipid fractions of Choanephora cucurbitarum grown under different cultural conditions were analyzed by thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography. It was observed that temperature, age, pH, and light influenced the degree of unsaturation, this being due mainly to changes in the gamma-linolenic acid concentration. The conditions used in this study did not alter the qualitative profile of fatty acids normally present in the organism. Neither did these conditions stimulate the production of further long-chain fatty acids (C20-C26) beyond gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3) as reported earlier using growth media containing glutamic acid. The fatty acid pattern of lipid fractions though the same qualitatively, differed quantitatively. The polar lipid fractions, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and diphosphatidyl glycerol showed an appreciable variation in gamma-linolenic acid content under different cultural conditions. The degree of unsaturation of the various lipid fractions decreased with increases in temperature, light intensity, and pH, but within each treatment the same pattern of decreasing degree of unsaturation with increasing age was observed. The significance of these observations is discussed.

4243|t|Purification and properties of human acid-thermostable ribonucleases, and diagnosis of childhood pancreatic fibrosis.
4243|a|Acid-thermostable ribonucleases were isolated from human pancreas, duodenal contents, liver, spleen, serum and urine, and purified 15--1000-fold. The pH optima, ionic requirements, and some of the specificity requirements, of these enzymes were investigated. The isolated enzymes formed two distinct groups: (a) The ribonucleases of the pancreas, duodenal contents and fraction A of serum and urine exhibit a pH optimum of 8.5, are inhibited by An2+ and Cu2+, and relatively rapidly hydrolyze the synthetic substrate uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate); (b) the ribonucleases of the liver and spleen, and of fractions B of the serum and urine, with a pH optimum of 7, are less sensitive to An2+ and Cu2+, and exhibit negligible activity versus uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate). Determination of the serum level of pancreatic-type ribonuclease activity, with the use of uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate) or RNA as substrates, appears to be a valid diagnostic tool for pancreatic fibrosis in children.

4297|t|The effects of neurally active amino acids on prolactin secretion.
4297|a|Several neurally active amino acids were injected into the third ventricle of anesthetized male rats. Two or eight mumole of GABA produced significant increases in the plasma concentrations of prolactin (PRL), indicating increased PRL release from the pituitary. Two mumole of glycine was also effective in elevating PRL levels. The intraventricular injection of the lowest dose of GABA (1.0 mumole), glutamate (0.4 or 2.3 mumole), lysine (0.2 or 2.0 mumole), or 0.9% NaCl did not alter PRL levels significantly. Plasma PRL concentrations did not increase following the injection of GABA or glycine directly into the anterior pituitary gland. The results suggest that GABA and glycine may play a role in the neural regulation of PRL secretion.

4392|t|The presence of paternal H-2 antigens on hybrid mouse blastocysts during experimental delay of implantation and the disappearance of these antigens after onset of implantation.
4392|a|The presence of paternal H-2 antigens on hybrid mouse blastocysts before and during implantation was investigated by means of the isotope anti-globulin technique. It was found that experimentally delayed blastocysts possess paternal H-2 antigens whereas these antigens can no longer be detected 14 hours after estradiol activation of delayed blastocysts.

4439|t|Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Purification and partial characterization.
4439|a|Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase has been purified 1000-fold from pig liver. This enzyme exists as an active dimer of molecular weight 133,000 and an inactive monomer of molecular weight 67,500. The pH of maximum activity is 8.5 and the ionic strength maximum is 0.1 to 0.5 M. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is highly specific for NADP+ and glucose 6-phosphate. Apparent Km values of 3.6 muM and 5.4 muM were obtained for glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+. This enzyme is located almost entirely within the soluble portion of the cellular cytoplasm.

4447|t|Solubilization and characterization of the beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites of frog erythrocytes.
4447|a|Specific beta-adrenergic receptors present in membrane preparations of frog erythrocytes were identified by binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, a potent competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist. The (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites could be solubilized by treatment of a purified erythrocyte membrane fraction with the plant glycoside digitonin but not by treatment with a wide variety of other detergents. The binding sites appeared to be soluble by several independent experimental criteria including (a) failure to sediment of 105,000 X g for 2 hours; (b) passage through 0.22-mu Millipore filters; (c) chromatography on Sepharose 6B gels; and (d) electron microscopy. The soluble receptor sites retained all of the essential characteristics of the membrane-bound sites, namely rapid and reversible binding of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; strict stereospecificity toward both beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; appropriate structure-activity relationships; saturability of the sites at low concentrations of ligand; no affinity for alpha-adrenergic drugs, nonphysiologically active catechol compounds, and catecholamine metabolites. Based on gel chromatography in the presence of detergent, the molecular weight of the soluble receptor is estimated to be no greater than 130,000 to 150,000. Equilibrium binding studies indicated a KD for the soluble receptor of 2 nM. Hill coefficients (nH) of 0.77 and curved Scatchard plots suggested the presence of negatively cooperative interactions among the solubilized receptors in agreement with previous findings with the membrane-bound sites. Kinetic studies indicated an association rate constant K1 = 3.8 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and a reverse rate constant k2 = 2.3 X 10(-3) min-1 at 4 degrees. The kinetically derived KD (k2/k1) of 0.6 nM is in reasonable agreement with that determined by equilibrium studies. The soluble receptors were labile at temperature greater than 4 degrees but could be stabilized with high concentrations of EDTA. Guanidine hydrochloride and urea produced concentration-dependent losses of binding activity which were partially reversible upon dialysis. Trypsin and phospholipase A both degraded the soluble receptors but a variety of other proteases and phospholipases as well as DNase and RNase were without effect. Experiments with group-specific reagents indicated that free lysine, tryptophan, serine, and sulfhydryl groups may be important for receptor binding. These studies suggest that the receptor is probably a protein which requires lipids for functional integrity. Data obtained with the solubilized binding sites are consistent with the contention that these sites represent the physiologically relevant beta-adrenergic receptors which have been extracted from the membranes with full retention of their properties.

4449|t|Solubilization of thyroid peroxidase by nonionic detergents.
4449|a|We have examined the ability of nonionic detergents to solubilize thyroid peroxidase from a porcine thyroid particulate fraction, as measured by the release of peroxidase activity into the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 105,000 X g for 1 hour and the retardation of the supernatant peroxidase of Sepharose 6B. The parameters of peroxidase solubilization by Triton X-100 have been investigated in detail. Under optimum conditions, 60 to 95% of the thryoid peroxidase and about 50% of the total protein is released into the 105,000 X g, 1-hour supernatant. Under the optimum conditions established with Triton X-100, a series of Brij detergents of different chemical structure were equally effective in releasing peroxidase and protein. The protein patterns of the supernatants obtained with these detergents were similar on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, suggesting that the detergents studied release similar membrane proteins. The Triton X-100 and Brij 58 supernatants were chromatographed separately on Sepharose 6B equilibrated with 0.1% Triton X-100 or Brij 58, respectively. In both cases, 75 to 80% of the peroxidase activity was retarded, thereby indicating that the nonionic detergents effect solubilization of the peroxidase rather than dispersal of nonsedimentable membrane fragments. These studies report the first successful solubilization of thyroid peroxidase by nonionic detergents. Together with previous evidence from our laboratory, these experiments indicate that thyroid peroxidase is an integral membrane protein.

4459|t|L-Asparaginase of Klebsiella aerogenes. Activation of its synthesis by glutamine synthetase.
4459|a|An L-asparaginase has been purified some 250-fold from extracts of Klebsiella aerogenes to near homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 141,000 as measured by gel filtration and appears to consist of four subunits of molecular weight 37,000. The enzyme has high affinity for L-asparagine, with a Km below 10(-5) M, and hydrolyzes glutamine at a 20-fold lower rate, with a Km of 10(-3) M. Interestingly, the enzyme exhibits marked gamma-glutamyltransferase activity but comparatively little beta-aspartyl-transferase activity. A mutant strain lacking this asparaginase has been isolated and grows at 1/2 to 1/3 the rate of the parent strain when asparagine is provided in the medium as the sole source of nitrogen. This strain grows as well as the wild type when the medium is supplemented with histidine or ammonia. Glutamine synthetase activates the formation of L-asparaginase. Mutants lacking glutamine synthetase fail to produce the asparaginase, and mutants with a high constitutive level of glutamine synthetase also contain the asparaginase at a high level. Thus, the formation of asparaginase is regulated in parallel with that of other enzymes capable of supplying the cell with ammonia or glutamate, such as histidase and proline oxidase. Formation of the asparaginase does not require induction by asparaginase and is not subject to catabolite repression.

4465|t|Demonstration and some properties of cytosol-binding proteins for thyroxine and triiodothyronine in human liver.
4465|a|Cytosol-binding proteins for L-thyroxine (T4) and triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) were studied in human liver specimens obtained at autopsy from 5 male and 2 female subjects. The liver cytosol containing 131I-T4 or T3, together with or without added stable hormones, was fractionated by Pevikon thin-layer electrophoresis at pH 8.6, 8.0, and7.4. It was demonstrated in all the specimens that besides a small amount of serum T4-binding globulin, there existed three T4-binding proteins, termed hT4-1, hT4-2 and hT4-3, with the electrophoretic mobilities of alpha2- and beta-globulins, and two T3-binding proteins, termed hT3-1 and hT3-2, with the mobilities of gamma-globulin. Binding of hormones by the cytosol proteins was pH-dependent, and a preliminary dialysis had no effect on the hormone binding. The major band of T4, hT4-2, bound more than half the tracer T4, and possessed the maximal binding capacity of 110 mug/100 ml of 33% cytosol at pH 7.4. However, it showed no apparent affinity for T3, because the bound T4 could not be displaced with a T3 load of 600 mug/100 ml. The major band of T3, hT3-2, bound more than 70% of the tracer T3, and appeared to have a large capacity for the hormone although secondary binding sites on the same molecule might be responsible for the large capacity. The binding sites appeared almost specific for T3, because only a small, insignificant displacement was noted with a T4 load of 600 mug/100 ml. The results provide evidence for distinct binding proteins for T4 and T3 in the human liver cytosol, though their physiological roles remain to be elucidated.

4476|t|Dephosphorylation of bovine casein by milk alkaline phosphatase.
4476|a|The pH of optimum activity of alkaline phosphatase from cow's milk depended on the substrate, being 10-1 for rho-nitrophenylphosphate, 8-6 for phosphoserine, 8-0 for phosvitin and 6-8 for casein. Individual casein components were dephosphorylated more rapidly than mixtures of alphas- and beta-caseins or of alphas-, beta-and kappa-caseins and micellar casein. Mixtures of 2 components involving kappa-casein were more readily dephosphorylated than alphas- and beta-casein mixtures. At pH 6-8, lactose, whey proteins and phosphate ions had an inhibitory effect. beta-Lactoglobulin had an inhibitory effect only when the pH of the reaction was lower than the optimum pH value of the enzyme. Mg2+ and Zn2+ were not inhibitory. The optimum conditions for dephosphorylation of casein are described.

4478|t|Bovine pancreatic lipase.I.Isolation, homogeneity, and characterization.
4478|a|Bovine pancreatic lipase was isolated in pure form by lyophilization of fresh bovine pancreas, extraction of the enzyme with sucrose solution, fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate and acetone, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The specific activity of the purest lipase fraction was 1750 micromoles fatty acid, liberated in 30 min per milligram of protein, indicating a purification of approximately 473-fold, with an overall yield of about 42%. Homogeneity of the enzyme was confirmed by rechromatography on Sephadex G-100 as well as with the gel electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal techniques. The purified enzyme gave a typical protein ultraviolet absorption spectrum with maximum absorption at 276 nm and minimum at 252 nm. The purified enzyme exhibited a single pH optimum of 8.8 and an isoelectric point near pH 5.5. Its optimum temperature was 37 C, and its optimum substrate concentration was 10%. These properties resembled those of milk lipase.

4573|t|Further observations on the potentiation of the antibacterial effect of methenamine by acetohydroxamic acid.
4573|a|The use of methenamine in the treatment of urinary tract infections due to Proteus species is limited by urine alkalinity. Acetohydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of urease, maintains acidity despite growth of Proteus in urine. Easily achievable concentrations of acetohydroxamic acid in vitro systems that simulated the dynamics of the urinary tract potentiated the antibacterial effect of methenamine against Proteus species. The combined use of a urease inhibitor and methenamine may be effective in the treatment of urinary infection caused by these organisms.

4606|t|Vasoconstrictor actions of delta8- and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the rat.
4606|a|Cardiovascular effects of delta8- and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were studied after systemic intravenous administration and intra-arterial administration into a perfused vascular bed in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Intravenous administration of delta8- and delta9-THC produced dose-related transient increases in blood pressure followed by more prolonged hypotensive responses and bradycardia. Intra-arterial administration of delta8- and delta9-THC into the perfused hindquarters of the rat produced an increase in perfusion pressure indicative of vasoconstriction. The vasoconstrictor response to the cannabinoids corresponded temporally to a similar response produced by i.a. norepinephrine and was in contrast to the more prolonged vasoconstrictor responses produced by vasopressin. Phentolamine, in a dose which reduced the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine by 90%, significantly reduced the response to i.a. delta9-THC while having no effect on the actions of i.a. vasopressin. It was demonstrated that reserpine pretreatment significantly reduced vasoconstrictor actions of i.a. tyramine and delta9-THC but did not alter the responses to norepinephrine. These data suggest that delta8- and delta9-THC have peripheral vasoconstrictor activity in the rat which may be mediated, in part, through a tyramine-like action on adrenergic nerve terminals.

4615|t|[Blood acid-base changes produced by variations of water oxygenation in the crab Carcinus maenas (author's transl)].
4615|a|10 Blood acid-base changes were studied at 17 degrees C in immersed crabs (Carcinus maenas) exposed to hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions, by measuring the pH and the CO2 partial pressure, PbCO2, and by calculating the bicarbonate concentration. 20 Hyperoxia first induces a marked respiratory acidosis with a rise of PbCO2. This acidosis is compensated thereafter by a non-ventilatory increase of the blood buffer base concentration. These results are discussed in relation to the general problems concerning the control of the blood acid-base balance in aquatic animals.

4648|t|[Conditioning of water regenerated from moisture-containing wastes].
4648|a|Conditioning of reclaimed water with minerals and trace elements by means of filters made of silver-plated natural minerals containing calcium, magnesium, fluoride and iodine ions has been investigated. On the basis of the investigations a complex filter made of silver plated minerals--dolomite and fluorite--has been developed. This filter allows simultaneous mineralization and decontamination of reclaimed water and preparation of biologically complete potable water.

4660|t|Effect of alcohol on elicited male sexual response.
4660|a|Sixteen young men drunk three doses of alcohol and their sexual arousal was measured by the changes in penile diameter. The lowest alcohol dose (BAC of 0.025%) was associated with maximum penile diameter increase; marked suppression of response was found at BACs of 0.05% and above.

4662|t|Decrease of iconic memory after alcohol.
4662|a|Alcohol did not alter the rate of information loss from iconic memory. However, there was a dose-related decrease in the total amount of information reported which was independent of the rate of information loss.

4666|t|Viability of cells in ethanol. Role of alcohol dehydrogenase.
4666|a|Rodent cells were found to contain a high level of alcohol dehydrogenase activity which was not inducible. Other hepatoma and nonhepatoma cell lines were tested and found to contain lower but measurable levels of alcohol dehydrogenase.

4727|t|Ferredoxin-dependent photosynthetic reduction of nitrate and nitrite by particles of Anacystis nidulans.
4727|a|The dark and light reduction of nitrate and nitrite by cell-free preparations of the blue-green alga Anacystis nidulans has been investigated. The three following methods have been successfully applied to the preparation of active particulate fractions from the alga cells: (a) shaking with glass beads, (b) lysozyme treatment and lysis of the resulting protoplasts, and (c) sonication. The two enzymes of the nitrate-reducing system-namely, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase-are firmly bound to the isolated pigment-containing particles, and can be easily solubilized by prolonging the vibration or sonication time. Both enzymes-whether solubilized or bound to the particles-depend on reduced ferredoxin as the immediate electron donor. In its presence, the alga particles catalyze the gradual photoreduction of nitrate to nitrite and ammonia, a process that can thus be considered as one of the most simple and relevant examples of Photosynthesis. Some of the properties of nitrate reductase have been studied. Nitrate reductase as well as nitrite reductase are adaptive enzymes repressed by ammonia.

4766|t|Phosphate transport by isolated renal brush border vesicles.
4766|a|A sodium dependent specific transport system for phosphate is present in the brush border microvilli but absent from the basal-lateral plasma membranes. The apparent affinity of this transport system for phosphate is 0.08 mM at 100 mM sodium and pH 7.4. It is inhibited competitively by arsenate with an apparent inhibitor constant of 1.1 mM (100 mM sodium, pH 7.4). Sodium dependent phosphate uptake is two times higher at pH 8 compared to the uptake observed at pH 6. The apparent affinity of the transport system for sodium is also pH-dependent, half-maximal stimulation of uptake is found at pH 6 with 129 mM sodium, at pH 7.4 with 60 mM sodium and at pH 8 with 50 mM sodium. Under all conditions a nonhyperbolic dependence of phosphate uptake on the sodium concentration is observed. The uptake of phosphate by brush border microvilli vesicles shows a typical overshoot phenomenon in the presence of sodium gradient across the membrane (CNao greater than CNai). The amount of pohsphate taken up after 2 min is about twice the equilibrium value reached after 2 h of incubation. At pH 7.4 the initial rate of uptake is increased only slighyly (12%) by inside negative membrane diffusion potentials and inhibited to the same extent by inside positive membrane diffusion potentials. These results indicate that the entry of phosphate across the brush border membrane into the epithelial cell of the proximal tubule is coupled to the entry of sodium. The transfer of phosphate is dependent on its concentration gradient and on the concentration difference of sodium. The data are best explained by the following hypothesis: Both the primary phosphate as well as the secondary phosphate are transported in cotransport with sodium. The divalent form however seems to be transported preferentially. Its transport occurs electroneutral with 2 sodium ions; the monovalent phosphate also enters the cell together with 2 sodium ions but as a positively charged complex. The exit of phosphate across the contraluminal cell border is sodium independent and is favoured by the high intracellular phosphate concentration and the inside negative membrane potential.

4780|t|Pharmacologic therapy of asthma.
4780|a|Asthma is treated by avoiding the precipitants of symptoms, by a trial of hyposensitization (immunotherapy) if the precipitant cannot be avoided, and principally by pharmacologic therapy. Acute attacks have been most widely treated with epinephrine, but adrenergic aerosol bronchodilators and aminophylline are being used increasingly. When an acute attack of asthma does not respond to treatment, a diagnosis of status asthmaticus should be considered and the patient treated in a hospital intensive care unit because of the potentially life-threatening sequela of respiratory failure. Periodic mild episodes of asthma usually respond to administration of an oral bronchodilator. Chronic low-grade asthma is best treated with an around-the-clock regimen of theophylline. Patients whose asthma is not under satisfactory control with conventional bronchodilators may be given a trial of cromolyn sodium. Chronic severe cases may be treated with corticosteroids, but these drugs must be skillfully administered to avoid adverse effects.

4794|t|A 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase specific for prostaglandin A in rabbit kidney.
4794|a|Examination of a soluble fraction derived from homogenates of rabbit kidney papilla revealed the existence of a 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase specific for A-type prostaglandins. Prostaglandins of the E- and F-series were not substrates for this enzyme. In agreement with published data, the 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase(s) derived from the kidney cortex were found to degrade all prostaglandins examined (PGE, PGF, PGA) in the presence of added cofactor NAD. Thus it is evident that in this species the kidney 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenases are anatomically compartmentalized so that the papilla is able to metabpable of degrading E-, F-, and A-type prostaglandins by this metabolic pathway.

4820|t|Schedule-induced oral self administration of etonitazene.
4820|a|Rats were induced to drink either a saline-etonitazene solution or a saline solution with a schedule-induced polydipsia paradigm. When water was freely available, the rats continued to drink the saline solution or the saline-etonitazene solution, rather than the water. When the locations of the solutions were switched, the rats that were drinking saline switched to water (drank at the usual location), but the rats that were drinking saline-etonitazene continued to drink the saline-etonitazene solution (drank from the bottle at the other location). Naloxone administration temporarily eliminated the drinking of saline-etonitazene solution, but not that of saline solution.

4948|t|The effect of halothane anaesthesia upon cerebral oxygen consumption in the rat.
4948|a|The influence of halothane (0.6 and 2%) upon cerebral (cortical) blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRo2) was studied in artificially ventilated rats, using a modified technique of Kety & Schmidt (1948). The values obtained in halothane anaesthesia were compared to those recorded in nitrous oxide anaesthesia, or to those measured in unanesthetized animals given an analgesic drug (fentanyl citrate). Although it could be confirmed that halothane induces vasodilatation in the brain, there were relatively small differences in CBF between the groups. The results demonstrate that, in the rat, halothane depresses CMRo2 in a dose-dependent way. With 0.6% halothane, CMRo2 was reduced by 20-30% and, with 2% halothane, CMRo2 was reduced by about 50%. Thus, in the rat the effect of 2% halothane upon metabolic rate is comparable to that observed in barbiturate anaesthesia.

5014|t|[Physico-chemical characteristics, absorption and elimination kinetics and technics of use of enflurane].
5014|a|Physical-chemical properties, uptake und elemination of enflurane are described with particular references to halothane. The ratio potency/vapor pressure, the blood and tissues solubility of this agent provide a good flexibility of uptake and elemination in response to changes in alveolar ventilation. When used with nitrous oxide, the enflurane may provide good clinical results at inspired concentration 1-2 p. 100.

5022|t|[The utilization of EB 51 in parenteral feeding. Clinical, biological and anatomopathological control. Statistical study on 30 patients].
5022|a|Two groups of patients (comas of central origin and serious digestive undernourished) were submitted to an exclusive or a supplementary parenteral feeding for a short or a long period of time totaling over 500 days. The catheter was placed (in 80 p. cent of the cases) in a deep vein and was tunnellized. EB 51 (Trivemil) used in those 30 patients gives amino-acids, lipids and glucides. The caloric intake was completed by 30 p. cent glucose solutes. If the average caloric intake was 3.000 calories per day, it was often above that figure since the feeding was combined with a nutri-pump enteral feeding for 60 p. cent of the days. The clinical tolerance was quite good. On a biological level, in addition to classic investigations, 40 analytic graphic records of lipid levels were made, as well as a quantitative analysis of serous triglycerides and lipurias, a study of sorbitol and 500 nitrogen balances combined with 150 chromatographies on the acidaminuria column. An hepatic biological control was also made (amnoniemia, transaminases) as well as a quantitative analysis of lactates, pyruvates and minerals: iron-phosphorus-magnesium. Some of the results were checked by statistical studies. No serious anomaly was detected. Lung and hepatic biopsies carried out upon 9 patients did not apparently reveal any lipidic overloading. The clinical and the biological investigation show that this complete nutriment is perfectly tolerated and assimilated.

5033|t|[Dopamine and shock. Preliminary clinical study of 7 cases].
5033|a|Seven patients presenting a state of shock were treated with dopamine. The authors remark an undeniable effect on arterial pressure which rises again and on the diuresis.

5052|t|Susceptibility of pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae to antibacterial agents.
5052|a|Strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were tested for susceptibility to numerous antibiotics by a twofold agar dilution method using an inocula replicator. Undiluted, fully grown broth cultures were used as inocula for both species, and cultures of pneumococci diluted 1:1,000 were also tested. The antibiotics included most of those in common use in the United States as well as some chemical modifications recently approved and others that are under investigation. The most striking aspect of the results was the marked susceptibility of the pneumococci to all the antibiotics tested except the polymyxins and most of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, although some new aminoglycosides were active in quite low concentrations. Some of the strains of pneumococci were of decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (minimal inhibitory concentrations, 0.2 to 0.4 mug/ml), but none were tetracycline resistant, although such strains had been reported previously from this laboratory. The strains of H. influenzae, which were all serologically nontypable, exhibited different patterns of susceptibility to the groups of antibiotics and to the individual chemically related ones. None of these strains (isolated early in 1972) were ampicillin resistant. The most active agents against H. influenzae were: carbenicillin and ampicillin, analogues related to each of them, rifampin, chloramphenicol, and the polymyxins. However, the tetracycline analogues other than tetracycline, some aminoglycosides, notably tobramycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and verdamicin, erythromycin, and some new lincomycin analogues were also active in low concentrations. Trimethoprim alone was highly active, and in combination with sulfamethoxazole it was even more active and synergistic against strains of both D. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.

5053|t|Comparative incidence of phlebitis due to buffered cephalothin, cephapirin, and cefamandole.
5053|a|Buffered cephalothin, cefamandole, and cephapirin were compared with respect to their tendency to produce phlebitis. Two grams of each agent was administered every 6 h for 4 days to 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind crossover fashion. Approximately 50% of intravenous sites developed mild (grade 1) phlebitis and 25% developed moderate (grade 2) phlebitis. The frequency of grade 1 inflammation did not differ significantly among the three cephalosporins. The proportion of individuals eventually exhibiting grade 2 phelebitis was highest with cefamandole, lowest with cephalothin (P = 0.07), and intermediate with cephapirin; however, cephapirin required a substantially greater number of doses to produce grade 2 phelebitis than did the other two drugs. These findings, together with the results of other reports, suggest that interpretation of the phlebitogenic potential of these antibiotics must be made with caution.

5105|t|The effects of grass and concentrate diets on the specific activities of some enzymes of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism in sheep.
5105|a|Feeding sheep a concentrate diet compared with grass diets increased the hepatic specific activities of the three glycolytic enzymes studied, and that of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49) and reduced the specific activity of D-fructose-I, 6-diphosphate I-phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.11). The specific activities of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.43) and malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.40) were unaffected by diet.

5108|t|Synthesis and properties of carbonylbis(methionyl)insulin, a proinsulin analogue which is convertible to insulin by cyanogen bromide cleavage.
5108|a|The preparation and use of carbonylbis (L-methionine p-nitrophenyl ester) as a reversible cross-linking reagent for insulin are described. The reaction of 1 equiv of reagent with zinc insulin in dimethylformamide in the presence of triethylamine yields as one of the products NalphaA1, NepsilonB29-carbonylbis(methionyl)insulin, (CBM-insulin). The CBM-insulin was characterized by end group analysis and by the products formed on tryptic and chymotryptic cleavage. It possessed 91% of the immunological and 6.5% of the hormonal activity of insulin. Treatment of CBM-insulin with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) in 70% formic acid for 1 h resulted in nearly complete removal of the methionine bridge to yield insulin. A small amount of a side product was removed on DEAE-cellulose at pH 7.2 to give an overall recovery of insulin of 70-80%. Oxidative sulfitolyses of CBM-insulin gave the hexa(S-sulfonate) which was reduced with dithiothreitol to yield reduced CBM-insulin. The latter compound, containing 6 sulfhydryls, exhibited a pH-dependent circular dichroic spectrum. The form at pH 10 exhibited a spectrum typical of random coil which was converted to a form at pH 7.8 which was characterized by a negative extremum at 213 nm. The change in the spectrum at 213 nm with pH was characterized by an apparent pKa of 8.5. Studies on the reoxidation of reduced CBM-insulin were performed at pH values between 7.8 and 10 and at protein concentrations of 0.01-1 mg/ml. The best yields (ca. 85%) of the correctly paired disulfide bonds were obtained in reoxidations at pH 9.5-10 at protein concentration of 0.01-0.1 mg/ml. CBM-insulin, which had been isolated from reoxidation at high pH of the reduced CBM-insulin, was cleaved by CNBr to yield a fully active insulin in an overall yield of 60% from the reduced CBM-insulin.

5109|t|DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the thermophilic bacterium Caldariella acidophila. Purification and basic properties of the enzyme.
5109|a|A DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been isolated from Caldariella acidophila, a thermophilic bacterium living in acidic hot springs at temperatures ranging from 63 to 89 degrees C. The enzyme was purified 180-fold and is composed of five different subunits having the following molecular weights: a = 127000, b = 120000, c = 72000, d = 65000, and e = 38000. The enzyme is activated by Mn2+ and Mg2+ and exhibits optimal activity in the presence of 0.5 mM Mn2+. The activity depends on ionic strength, with a maximum at 0.25 M KCl, and exhibits a pH optimum at 7.8 in the presence of Tris-HCl buffer. The enzyme shows a high degree of thermophilicity, its temperature optimum being 80 degrees C in the in vitro assay. The thermophilicity of C. acidophila RNA polymerase allows studies on enzyme-template interactions to be performed in a temperature range where many templates are close to their Tm.

5115|t|Role of mannosyl lipid intermediate in the synthesis of Neurospora crassa glycoproteins.
5115|a|Particulate membrane preparations from Neurospora crassa incorporated mannose from GDP-[14C] mannose into endogenous lipid and particulate protein acceptors. Synthesis of the mannosyl lipid is reversible in the presence of GDP. Chemical and chromatographic characterization of the mannosyl lipid suggest that it is a mannosylphosphorylpolyisoprenol. The other endogenous acceptor was precipitated by trichloracetic acid. Gel filtration and electrophoresis studies before and after treatment with proteolytic enzymes indicate that the second acceptor is a glycoprotein(s). beta Elimination studies on the mannosyl protein formed from GDP-[14C] mannose with Mg2+ in the reaction mixture or formed from mannosyl lipid indicate thad with the peptide chain. Several lines of evidence indicate that in Neurospora crassa the mannosyl lipid is an obligatory intermediate in the in vitro mannosylation of the protein. (a) At 15 degrees C the initial formation of the mannosyl lipid is faster than the initial formation of the mannosyl protein. (b) Exogenous partially purified mannosyl lipid can function as a mannosyl donor for the synthesis of the mannosyl protein. This reaction was also dependent on a divalent metal. The rate of this reaction was optimal at a concentration of Triton X-100 which effectively inhibited the transfer of mannose from GDP-[14C] mannose to lipid and protein, indicating that GDP-mannose was not an intermediate in the transfer of mannose from lipid to protein. The mannosyl protein formed in this reaction was indistinguishable by several criteria from the mannosyl protein formed from GDP-[14C] mannose and Mg2+. (c) The effect of a chase with an excess of unlabeled GDP-mannose on the incorporation of mannose into endogenous acceptors was immediate cessation of the synthesis and subsequent turnover of the mannosyl lipid; in contrast, however, incorporation of mannose into protein continued and was proportional to the loss of mannose from the mannosyl lipid.

5119|t|Hydrogen ion titration of horse heart ferricytochrome c.
5119|a|Continuous hydrogen ion titration curves of deionized solutions of horse heart ferricytochrome c have been obtained at 25 degrees C. at a constant ionic strength of 0.10 from pH 3.0 to 11.0. Titration of the oxidized protein in KCl required 28.4 equiv over that pH range, and a small hysteresis between the forward and reverse limbs was displayed. The Linderstrom-Lang approximation, which takes into account electrostatic interactions between charged groups on the protein surface, was used in a computer simulation program to analyze the forward and reverse limbs of the titration curve separately. The results indicated 1 alpha-, 12 beta- and gamma-, and 1 heme propionic carboxylic, 1 imidazole, 1 phenolic, and 18 epsilon-amino residues appear to titrate normally. Variations in the electrostatic interaction factor omega suggest conformational changes in the protein at the extremes of pH, although the relationship of the variations in omega to the magnitude of the conformational changes does not appear to be strictly quantitative for cytochrome c. These results show the acid-base behavior of cytochrome c to be complex in nature, and suggest that the Lindenstrom-Lang model may not be adequate for cytochrome c.

5128|t|Cooperative reactions of poly-L-lysine-heme complex with molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, or cyanide ion.
5128|a|The interaction of the alpha-helical poly-L-lysine-heme complex with molecular oxygen, carbon monoxide, or cyanide ion was studied. Binding equilibrium curve and activation parameters for the reactions were determined. Sigmoid responses were observed for the absorption of molecular oxygen or carbon monoxide by the complex and the cooperative parameter was found to be 2.1. This indicated a cooperative interaction between hemes situated on a cylindrical alpha-helix of poly-L-lysine. But those of other polymer-ligand-heme complexes were 1.0. The cooperative reaction mechanism, in which an alpha-helical poly-L-lysine plays an important role, was suggested.

5135|t|Endogenous proteolytic activity and constituent polypeptide chains of sheep and pig 19 S thyroglobulin.
5135|a|Porcine and ovine 19-S thyroglobulins prepared from frozen glands in several buffers using slice extraction or homogenization, ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography or Sepharose 6B gel filtration were contaminated with protease activity of pH optima 4.5 and 8.6, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Optimum temperatures of autodigestion were 37 degrees C at pH 4.5 and 25 degrees C at pH 8.6. Thyroglobulins prepared from unfrozen glands pH 7.2 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate using slice extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation and Sepharose 6B gel filtration were devoid of acid proteolytic activity but still underwent autodigestion at pH 8.6. Diisopropylfluorophosphate was a potent inhibitor of the alkaline protease activity of ovine thyroglobulin preparations. In contrast to thyroglobulin obtained from frozen glands the proteins purified from fresh unfrozen glands at pH 7.2 only showed the 19-S and the 12-S species by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. Very few bands migrating faster than 12-S were visible. After full reduction and S-alkylation of porcine and ovine thyroglobulins, no qualitative changes were observed in the gel electrophoresis pattern as compared to the unmodified proteins. Species of apparent mol. wt. corresponding to the native 12 S were the major component, strongly suggesting a mol. wt. of about 330 000 for the elementary peptide chains of pig and sheep thyroglobulins.

5210|t|A modified inactivation-inhibition method for determining the serum activity of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes.
5210|a|A procedure using heat inactivation and L-phenylalanine inhibition to quantitate the activities of bone, liver and intestinal alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes in human serum was confirmed by alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme analysis using an electrophoretic procedure. The results of this assay were compared with the radionuclear 85Sr test, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in a group of patients with hepatobiliary and bone diseases.

5255|t|Binding of radioactivity from (14C)thiourea to rat lung protein.
5255|a|Binding of radioactivity from [14C]thiourea (TU) to rat lung protein was found to occur in vitro. Two binding sites are present. One possesses low affinity/high capacity while the other is characterized by high affinity/low capacity. In vitro binding of [14C]TU to lung protein can be antagonized by the presence of either unlabeled congeners (alpha-napthylthiourea or phenylthiourea) or thiol-containing compounds (cysteine, reduced glutathione). Conversely, depletion of lung-reduced glutathione by means of diethyl maleate administration results in elevated protein binding. Prior administration (24 hr) of a sublethal dose of TU (which renders tolerance to a subsequent lethal dose in vivo) results in a decrease in in vitro binding of radioactivity from [14C)TU to lung protein. In addition, immature rats, which are less sensitive to the edematogenic effect of TU, bind less radioactivity from [14C]TU to lung protein when the drug is administered in vivo. These results suggest a correlation between [14C]TU binding to lung protein and the pathophysiological effect of the drug in the lung.

5256|t|Uptake and disposition of chlorinated biphenyls by isolated perfused rat liver.
5256|a|The hepatic disposition of four chlorinated biphenyls was studied in isolated perfused rat liver preparations perfused with 30% rat blood. Biliary excretion of 14C-labeled 4-chlorobiphenyl (1-CB): 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl (2-CB): 2,4,5,2',5'-pentachlorobiphenyl (5-CB) and 2,4,5,2',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (6-CB) appeared to be inversely related to increased chlorination. Each of the compounds was rapidly taken up by the liver from the circulating perfusate. After 4 hr of perfusion, biliary excretion of 14C from 1-CB, 2-CB, 5-CB, and 6-CB was 48.2, 29.6, 20.5, and 1.3% of total dose, respectively. For 1-CB, this rate of biliary elimination represents a maximum perfusate/bile ratio of 107. About 97% of the label in the bile from 1-CB experiments was in the form of metabolites. Biliary excretion of 1-CB was biphasic: an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 = 13 min) was followed by a slower second phase (t 1/2 = 122 min). When the metabolites of 1-CB were added to the perfusate, biliary excretion of these metabolites was monophasic; t 1/2 = 120 min, which corresponded to the slower phase observed when the parent compound was presented to the liver. 1-CB disappeared from the perfusate via a biphasic process. Metabolites of 1-CB effused into the perfusate immediately after the initial rapid uptake of 1-CB by the liver, and the recirculating pool of metabolites was eliminated in the bile by the slow postsynthetic phase of biliary elimination. Less than 2% of 1-CB was present as the parent compound in the perfusion system after 4 hr of perfusion. These findings indicate that the metabolism of 1-CB is not the limiting factor in the hepatic disposition of 1-CB and that the circulating metabolites of 1-CB effusing from the liver might be the major source for urinary excretion.

5260|t|Metabolism of trans-stilbene in rabbits and rats.
5260|a|The biotransformation of intramuscularly administered 14C-labeled trans-stilbene was investigated in both rabbits and rats. In rabbits radioactivity was excreted (78.8% in 17 days) almost exclusively in the urine. In rats, feces accounted for more than half of the total excretion (80.3% in 19 days). Hydroxylated metabolites in urine and feces were identified by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. They were 4-hydroxy and 4,4'-dihydroxystilbene, and the two monomethyl ethers of 3,4-dihydroxystilbene and 4,4'-dihydroxybibenzyl. In addition, four polyhydroxylated metabolites of stilbene and bibenzyl were identified in rat urine by comparison of gas-liquid chromatography retention times of their silyl derivatives with synthetic reference compounds. They were 3,4,4'-trihydroxystilbene, and 3,4-dihydroxy-, 3,4,4'=trihydroxy-, and 3,4,3',4'-tetrahydroxybibenzyl. Oxidative cleavage of trans-stilbene to benzoic acid and 4-hydroxy- and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was established by the presence of both the free acids and conjugates of these compounds in both rabbit and rat urine. Their glycine conjugates were identified by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by reverse isotope dilution procedures from unhydrolyzed rabbit and rat urine. Percentages obtained indicate that cleavage of trans-stilbene is more extensive in rabbits (9.5%) than in rats (2.7%).

5261|t|Qualitative metabolic fate of phenoxybenzamine in rat, dog, and man. Use of 15N-labeling.
5261|a|Administration of an equimolar mixture of unlabeled and 15N-labeled phenoxybenzamine to rats and dogs facilitated identification of urinary metabolites by gas chromatography/chemical-ionization mass spectrometry by virtue of the the conspicuous equal-intensity ion pairs produced. By use of this technique N-benzyl-N-phenoxyisopropylamine (III), N-benzyl-N-(p-hydroxy-phenoxyisopropyl)amine (IV), and 2-benzylamino-1-propanol (VI) were identified as metabolites in rats. Phenoxyisopropylamine (V) as well as III and IV were identified in dogs. Compound IV was identified in humans under clinical treatment with phenoxybenzamine. The metabolites were screened for cardiovascular activity in rats. Compound III had weak alpha-adrenergic blocking activity and V elicited a hypertensive response.

5283|t|Assimilation of ammonia and growth of biotin deficient Aspergillus nidulans.
5283|a|Biotin deficiency in Aspergillus nidulans has been found to increase the uptake of ammonium ions, associated with a marked increase in the activity of NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase, which is found to be the major route of ammonia assimilation in this culture. The results obtained are discussed with respect to the growth of Aspergillus nidulans during biotin deficiency.

5424|t|D-alpha-Hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase of Rhodospirillum rubrum.
5424|a|D-alpha-Hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase of R. rubrum grown anaerobically in the light was partially purified and some properties were investigated. 1. The enzyme catalyze stoichiometrically the dehydrogenation reaction of D-alpha-hydroxyglutarate into alpha-oxoglutarate, coupled with the reduction of 2, 6-dichlorophenolindophenol. 2. Cytochrome c2, cytochrome c, and ferricyanide are effective as electron acceptors with the crude enzyme but not with the purified one, whereas NAD+ and NADP+ are completely ineffective. The enzyme is thought to play a role in the electron transport system of the organism. 3. D-alpha-Hydroxyglutarate is virtually the sole substrate for the enzyme. The apparent activity against L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate is presumed to be due to contamination of the L-isomer sample with the D-isomer. The enzyme shows barely detectable activity against both isomers of malate and virtually no activity against DL-lactate and glycolate. 4. Both isomers of malate and oxalate, which are presumably substrate analogues, inhibit the enzyme activity. 5. The enzyme is not an inducible enzyme but rather is a constitutive one for R. rubrum, unlike from the enzyme of Pseudomonas putida which is an inducible enzyme for the catabolism of lysine.

5434|t|Site-site interactions among insulin receptors. Characterization of the negative cooperativity.
5434|a|By studying the dissociation of 125I-instulin from its receptors in the absence and phe negatively cooperative type for the insulin receptors. In the present study we extend oy purified mouse and rat liver membranes as well as in human circulating monocytes and human cultured lymphocytes demonstrated negative cooperativity that was extraordinarily simn membranes more slowly than it does from its receptors on whole cells. The dissociaty a small percentage of the receptor sites (1 to 5%), are sufficient to accelerate dissociation of hormone from receptor. At these insulin concentrations insulin is entirely monomeric, and in fact at higher concentrations of insulin (greater than 10(-7) M) where insulin dimers predominate, the cooperativity effect is progressively lost. The dissociation rate of 125I-insulin alone (that is at very low fractional saturation of receptors) was markedly accelerated by dripping the pH from 8.0 to 5.0, whereas the dissociation of 125I-insulin at high receptor occupancy was only slightly accelerated by the fall in pH. The dissociation rate was directly related to temperature, but the dissociation rate of 125I-insulin at low receptor occupancy was much more affected by reduction in temperature and showed a sharp transition at 21 degrees. Urea at concentrations as low as 1 M produced a marked acceleration of 125I-insulin dissociation. Divalent cations (calcium and magnesium) appear to stabilize the insulin-receptor interaction, since higher degrees of receptor occupancy were required to achieve a given rate of dissociation of 125I-insulin. These data make it likely that the insulin receptors exist as oligomeric structures or clusters in the plasma membrane. Insulin receptor sites appear to switch from a "slow dissociating" state to a "fast dissociating" state when their occupancy increases; the proportion of sites in each state is a function of occupancy of the receptor sites by the insulin monomer as well as of the physiochemical environment. Other models which could explain apparent negative cooperativity besides site-site interactions, i.e. polymerization of the hormone, steric or electrostatic hindrance due to ligand-ligand interactions, or unstirred (Noyes-Whitney) layers are considered unlikely in the case of insulin receptors on both experimental and theoretical grounds.

5456|t|Purification and properties of a virion protein kinase.
5456|a|The protein kinase associated with virions of frog virus 3 was purified to apparent homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The enzyme protein appeared as a single polypeptide of molecular weight 50,000 to 55,000 as determined by gel filtration, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and comprised approximately 0.4% of the total virion protein. The activity was classified as a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase as it was not effected by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, or inhibited by a cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase inhibitor protein, and utilized GTP as well as ATP as a phosphate donor. The greatest rates of phosphorylation were obtained with acidic phosphoprotein substrates such as casein or phosvitin, although potential physiological substrates for this activity included specific virion polypeptides of frog virus.

5560|t|The binding of complement by complexes formed between a rabbit antibody and oligosaccharides of increasing size.
5560|a|Immune complexes formed between a homogeneous rabbit antibody to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide and a series of oligosaccharides of varying size derived from it were prepared and tested for their ability to fix guinea pig hemolytic complement. Antibody and either tetra-, hexa-, or octasaccharide formed only monomeric antibody-hapten complexes and did not show any complement binding. A dodecasaccharide and a 16-sugar residues oligomer formed dimer and trimer immune complexes. These complexes were also unable to fix complement. However, as the size of the sugar oligomers was increased to about 21 sugar residues per oligosaccharide molecule or more, the resulting complexes exhibited substantial complement binding, concomitant with the formation of antigen-antibody aggregates higher than trimers. On the other hand, an independent study carried out with the same material suggested changes in the conformation of the Fc moiety in the antibody molecule upon addition of oligosaccharide ligands as small as a 16-residue unit. Since the resulting complexes hardly ehibited any complement binding, ligand-induced conformational changes in the Fc part of the antibody molecule appears to be an insufficient condition per se for triggering complement fixation.

5561|t|Neonatal infection with mouse thymic virus: effects on cells regulating the antibody response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide.
5561|a|Mice infected neonatally with mouse thymic virus (TA) were evaluated at different ages with respect to their ability to give a plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide (SSS-III), as well as the degree of amplifier and suppressor thymus-derived (T) cell activity present. B cell activity matured rapidly from 2 to 4 weeks of age and was not affected by TA infection. Amplifier T cell activity matured progressively over the first 8 weeks of life and was transiently suppressed in TA-infected mice at 4 weeks of age. Suppressor T cell activity measured at 2,4, and 6 weeks of age was unaffected by TA. The findings suggest that TA is highly tropic for T cells and has selective effects on subpopulations of T cells.

5568|t|Effect on various putative neurotransmitters on the secretion of corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the rat hypothalamus in vitro-a model of the neurotransmitters involved.
5568|a|The effect of incubating the hypothalamus of adult male rats with various neurotransmitters upon the release of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) was studied. The CRH activity in the incubation medium was assayed in 48 h median eminence-lesioned rats and the corticosteroidogenesis of excised adrenals in vitro was used as the end-point. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (100 pg/ml-10ng/ml) caused a dose-dependent release of CRH which was antagonized by methysergide (30-100 ng/ml). The response to 5-hydroxytryptamine was also inhibited by hexamethonium and atropine which indicated that it was acting through a cholinergic interneurone. Melatonin (10 ng) did not alter the basal release of CRH but inhibited the action of both 5-hydroxytryptamine (10 ng) and acetylcholine (3 pg). Thus it appears that both 5-hydroxytryptamine and melatonin play a role in the control of CRH release. Noradrenaline blocked the release of CRH induced by both acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine and presumably this inhibition was caused by direct action on the CRH neurone. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) also inhibited the release of CRH and may also be involved in the regulation of CRH secretion. The inhibitory neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, GABA and melatonin, act via independent receptor mechanisms. A model based on the above data is presented.

5570|t|Acid-base balance in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) subjected to acid stresses.
5570|a|1. The respiratory properties of rainbow-trout blood were investigated in acid-stressed fish. In the first group acid was introduced into the bloodstream and in the second the carbon dioxide content of the ambient water was increased. 2. Initially the introduction of acid to the blood caused a decrease in blood pH and bicarbonate, and increases in oxygen uptake and ventilation volume. After 2-3 h these values had returned to the control levels. 3. Trout subjected to high ambient CO2 (about 10 mmHg) showed a decrease in blood pH while PCO2 and bicarbonate increased. After 8 h the trout began to show signs of compensation to the acidosis. 4. In each experiment the blood PO2 was little changed but blood O2 content was decreased and tended not to resume the control value even after several hours. 5. The results are discussed in terms of the various acid-base mechanisms thought to be available to the fish. These include branchial ion exchanges and the possible buffering roles of the extracellular and intracellular fluids.

5576|t|Effect of synthetic substance P on monoaminergic mechanisms in brain.
5576|a|Synthetic substance P has been discovered to stimulate significantly the formation of dopa in the limbic, striatum, hemisphere and diencephalon regions of the brain and the lower brain stem. There was no effect upon 5-hydroxytryptophan formation or on tryptophan or tyrosine levels. After inhibition of monoamine synthesis by N'-(DL-SERYL)-N2-(2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl)hydrazine, substance P significantly accelerated the disappearance of dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Substance P appears to stimulate monoaminergic neurons in the brain and to serve as an excitatory transmitter in nerve terminals impinging upon dopaminergic cell bodies. A similar stimulation of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine indicate a similar transmitter role for noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. These data strengthen questions about the possible clinical influence of substance P in disease states involving monoaminergic mechanisms including Parkinsonism and schizophrenia.

5591|t|Conformational populations for antihistamines and antihypertensives in solution.
5591|a|The conformations in aqueous solution were determined for the XCH2CH2N systems of some antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) and some adrenergic neuron blocking agents, including the antihypertensive drugs guanethidine and guanoclor. The rotameric species thought to be the pharmacologically active one is often not the only rotamer present in solution.

5600|t|Aminopyridines and sparteine as inhibitors of membrane potassium conductance: effects on Myxicola giant axons and the lobster neuromuscular junction.
5600|a|The effects of the compounds 2-, 3- and 4-aminopyridine and sparteine on membrane conductance changes were examined using both voltage-clamped Myxicola axons and the lobster neuromuscular junction. In Myxicola axons, the aminopyridines very specifically inhibited the potassium conductance when applied at concentrations of 0.1 mM to 5 mM without any apparent effect of resting membrane potential. Concentrations in excess of 5 mM were needed to inhibit noticeably the sodium conductance. Potassium conductance-voltage curves were shifted in the depolarized direction along the voltage axis with no significant change in shape. There were only minor changes in the kinetics of potassium activation. In high potassium solutions, both inward and outward potassium currents were equally sensitive to the aminopyridines. Sparteine was, in general, found to be a more potent, but somewhat less specific, inhibitor of the potassium conductance. In contrast to the aminopyridines, sparteine was more effective when applied at basic pH and in addition tended to produce a noticeable degree of potassium inactivation. When applied to the lobster neuromuscular junction, 2-aminopyridine and sparteine dramatically increased the amplitude of both excitatory and inhibitory postjunctional potentials, with little or no change in resting potential, resting input conductance, reversal potential, or miniature end plate potential amplitude or frequency. Quantal content per fiber was increased by approximately a factor of 3 for the excitatory responses.

5614|t|Isolation and properties of the replicase of encephalomyocarditis virus.
5614|a|The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (replicase) of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus was found to be closely associated with the smooth membranes of infected BHK-21 cells. An RNA-dependent EMC replicase was extracted from the membranes with 0.15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1,1,2-trichlorotri-fluoroethane (Genetron 113) and further purified by high-salt dextran-polyethylene glycol phase separation, sievorptive chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The enzyme does not manifest strict specificity toward EMC RNA template. It can use also Qbeta RNA, rRNA of BHK cells, or poly(C). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified EMC replicase labeled with radioactive methionine revealed that, of all the stable EMC proteins, the enzyme contains predominantly the 56,000-dalton (E) polypeptide.

5643|t|Sweetening agents from natural sources.
5643|a|Sweetness is an important taste sensation to humans. The absence of suitable sweeteners as alternatives to cyclamates and saccharin has led to a renewed interest in sweeteners form natural sources. A brief review of the history of sweetener usage provides a basis for understanding our present heavy consumption of sweet substances. The structure of naturally-occurring compounds possessing a sweet taste range from simple sugars to complex, intensely sweet proteins. The structural types include monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, flavonoids, steroid saponins, dipeptides, and proteins. Some of these substances are not, strictly-speaking, natural but are derived from natural sources by relatively minor chemical modification. The properties of two non-sweet substances, miraculin and gymnemic acid, are included because of their close relationship to the subject of sweeteners. Miraculin causes sour substances to taste sweet and gymnemic acid selectively blocks sweet taste perception. The second part of the paper presents some of the work on monellin, the intensely sweet protein from "serendipity berries" (Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii). The physico-chemical studies of monellin provide convincing evidence that it is, indeed, a protein. Structural studies using denaturants and specific chemical modifications have provided a beginning of our understanding of the molecular basis of the sweet taste of monellin.

5668|t|[Old and new dangers of blood transfusion (author's transl)].
5668|a|The predominant danger of blood transfusion, even after the discovery of the ABO and Rh systems, is the immunological risk. This led in 1940 to a regulation of blood transfusion in Germany by official guidelines which were constantly adjusted in the light of new research results. The dangers due to deterioration on storage still receive too little attention although these may be of greater danger to the patient than immunisation risk. Also the assessment of other medical problems of transfusion is insufficiently applied to clinical routine.

5678|t|[Isolation of proteins with complex forming agents].
5678|a|Taking vegetable albumins for models, the authors report of the possibilities of isolating proteins (which cannot be precipitated isoelectrically) by using their property of forming complexes with tannin or poly-anions. The precipitation of proteins with dextran sulphate or polyphosphates, which is due to electrostatic interaction, depends on the pH value and the electrolyte content of the solution. Under appropriate experimental conditions, protein yields of 100% are achieved. By means of tannin, the proteins are completely precipitated in a wide range of pH. The protein component of the poly-anion-containing complexes is isolated by precipitation with salt or by thermal coagulation after dissolving of the complexes. The isolation of protein from the tannin complexes is preferably realized by reaction with coffeine.

5720|t|Observations and interpretation of x-ray absorption edges in iron compounds and proteins.
5720|a|X-ray absorption spectra near the Kalpha edge have been measured in various iron group compounds using the intense synchrotron radiation at the Stanford Synchrotron Research Project. In the cubic compounds KMF3 where M = Mn+2, Fe+2, Co+2, Ni+2, and Zn+2, well resolved lines were observed and assigned to the 1s leads to 3d, 1s leads to 4s, and 1s leads to 4p transitions. The observed energies agreed rather well with the spectroscopic energy levels of the Z + 1 ion and the intensities are shown to agree with those expected on the basis of one electron transitions of the form Z 1s2dn(L,S) leads to (Z + 1)1s2dnn'l'(L",S). The energies of the intense 1s leads to 4p transition increase by about 5 V going from KFeF3 to K2NaFeF6, but only by about 1 V from K4Fe(CN)6 to K3Fe(CN)6. The transitions confirm that upon oxidation of the hexacyanides the iron electronic structure barely changes. In the iron sulfur protein rubredoxin, where the iron is bound to a tetrahedron of sulfurs, the 1s leads to 3d transition was about seven times more intense than the same transition in an octahedrally coordinated compound. These intensities parallel those observed in the d-d transitions of optical spectra, because in both types of spectra the intensities depend upon 4p admixture. In the heme protein cytochrome c, upon oxidation the 1s leads to 4p transition shifts only about 1 V to higher energies similar to the iron hexacyanides. These results are discussed in terms of covalent bonding.

5761|t|Phospholipase A and acid lipase activity during release of lysosomal hydrolases.
5761|a|Hydrolysis of cardiac and hepatic lysosomal phospholipids by endogenous phospholipase A occurs during incubation at 37 degrees C at pH 5.0. Lysophospholipids and free fatty acids accumulate in association with release of hydrolases from the lysosomes into the supernatant. Acid-active neutral lipid lipases contribute to the release of free fatty acids. Albumin inhibits the production of these surface-active lipids as well as the release of hydrolases. The soluble phospholipase A is inhibited by albumin, soluble protein (cytoplasmic), heparin, and protamine sulfate. Thus, hydrolysis of lysosomal lipids, catalyzed by endogenous phospholipases, as well as acid-active neutral lipid lipases, may contribute significantly to the increased permeability, swelling, and subsequent lysis of lysosomes. Stabilization of the lysosomal membrane is associated with integrity of the structural lipids of the membrane.

5922|t|The effect of enflurane, isoflurane, fluroxene, methoxyflurane and diethyl ether anesthesia on ouabain tolerance in the dog.
5922|a|Digitalis tolerance in dogs anesthetized with enflurane, isoflurane, fluroxene, methoxyflurane, and diethyl ether was compared with that in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. Ouabain dosage needed to cause ventricular tachycardia was significantly higher than that of pentobarbital with all agents except fluroxene, as was the LD50. The relative potency of these anesthetics in converting ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm, in order of descending effectiveness, was: diethyl ether, methoxyflurane, enflurane, fluroxene, isoflurane, pentobarbital.

5950|t|[Physicochemical properties of 7-phenylacetamidodesacetoxy-cephalosporanic acid].
5950|a|7-phenylacetamidodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid was prepared by transformation of benzylpenicillin. The acid was subjected to potentiometric titration and investigation of its electrophoretic mobility at wide pH ranges. The data of the potentiometric titration and electrophoresis were used for calculation of the acid ionization constant. Minimum solubility of the acid was determined and the curve of its solubility at wide pH ranges was estimated.

5979|t|Isolation of a moderate halophilic ammonia-oxidizing bacterium, Nitrosococcus mobilis nov. sp.
5979|a|An ammonia-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from a sample of brackish water (North Sea, Harbour of Husum). It is a motile large coccus 1.5-1.7 mum in diameter. The extensive cytomembrane system occurring as flattened vesicles in the peripheral region of the cytoplasm and as intrusions into the center of the cytoplasm is to be emphasized as a characteristic mark of identification. The lithoautotrophically growing bacterium turned out to be an obligate halophile. Because of its physiological and morphological properties, we assigned it to the genus Nitrosococcus and propose the name Nitrosococcus mobilis.

6006|t|Kinetic studies on glucoamylase of rabbit small intestine.
6006|a|The kinetic properties of a maltase-glucoamylase complex with a neutral pH optimum, purified to homogeneity from the brush borders of the rabbit small intestine, are described. It has a broad range of substrate specificity, hydrolysing di- and poly-saccharides with alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 linkages. The Km and Vmax, values of the enzyme for the various substrates were determined. Starch and maltose were its best substrates. The kinetics of hydrolysis of two synthetic linear maltosaccharides, namely maltotriose and maltopentaose, were studied. Mixed-substrate incubation studies revealed the presence of at least two interacting sites on the enzyme, and the data were further analysed by the use of a number of non-substrate inhibitors.

6043|t|Complete tyrosine assignments in the high-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor selectively reduced and carboxamidomethylated at cystine 14-38.
6043|a|The low-field portions of the 250-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of native and chemically modified basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor have been studied as a function of pH over the range pH 5-13. In derivatives selectively reduced and carboxamidomethylated at cystine 14-38, resonances associated with 15 of the 16 protons of the aromatic rings of the four tyrosines of the inhibitor have been located and assigned to specific tyrosyl residues. Titrations of pH yielded pK's for tyrosines 10, 21, 23, and 35 in the modified inhibitor of 9.9, 10.6, 11.6, and 11.0, respectively. Resonances associated with the three nitrotyrosine 10 protons of the mononitrated derivative and the six nitrotyrosine 10 and 21 protons of the dinitrated derivative have been similarly located, assigned, and titrated, yielding pK's for nitrotyrosines 10 and 21 of 6.5 and 6.4, respectively. Previously reported results for derivatives with cystine 14-38 intact have been revised on the basis of new data. Comparison of these revised results with the new data for derivatives with modified cystine 14-38 reveals no changes in pK's for any tyrosine or nitrotyrosing ring and no changes in chemical shift for resonances of nitrotyrosine 21 or tyrosines 21 and 23. However, modification of cystine 14-38 causes significant changes in chemical shifts of resonances of the nearby nitrotyrosine 10 and tyrosine 10 and 35 rings. Tyrosine 35 remains relatively immobile, rotating less than 1600 times/s at 25 degrees C for pH's in the range 5-13.

6047|t|The subcellular distribution and partial characterization of cholinesterase activities of canine platelets.
6047|a|The multiple cholinesterase activities in canine platelets have been investigated. Platelets were homogenized by rapid decompression under nitrogen, glass tube/Teflon pestle, and glycerol lysis techniques. Rapid decompression under nitrogen technique was found to be the most efficient and gentle method for cell disruption. Homogenates were subfractionated using sodium diatrizoate density gradients. Marker enzyme assays and pulse labeling experiments with 5-hydroxyl[14C] tryptamine and [125I] thrombin on prepared subcellular fractions confirmed that the soluble, plasma membrane and the granule-1 fractions were all in reasonably pure form. Furthermore, labeling of the plasma membrane with [125I] thrombin is cited as the first successful attempt at attaining significantly bound marker for this structure. Cholinesterase activity distributions measured in these fractions indicated that about 30% of the activity was present in the plasma membrane, 50% in granule-1 and 5% in soluble fractions. Kinetic data of cholinesterase activities obtained from intact platelets, plasma membrane preparations and platelet release supernatants indicated that they are strikingly similar.

6048|t|Effect of Ca2+, ruthenium red and ageing on pregnenolone production by mitochondrial fractions from normal and luteinizing hormone treated rat testes.
6048|a|The effect of Ca2+ in vitro on pregnenolone production rates under various incubation conditions by mitochondrial fractions isolated from testes of normal rats and of rats after in vivo treatment with luteinizing hormone has been investigated. Concentrations of Ca2+ in the range of 0.1-0.5 mM stimulated succinate supported pregnenolone production in mitochondrial fractions from both control and luteinizing hormone treated testes. When mitochondrial fractions were isolated in 0.25 M sucrose without additions, Ca2+ in vitro increased succinate supported pregnenolone production rates in mitochondrial fractions isolated from control testes to a greater extent than in mitochondrial fractions, from luteinizing hormone treated testes. Production rates in control mitochondrial fraction, incubated in the presence of initial Ca2+ concentrations of 0.7 mM and higher were almost similar to production rates in relevant luteinizing hormone treated mitochondria.

6063|t|Effects of increased intracellular pH-buffering capacity on the light response of Limulus ventral photoreceptor.
6063|a|Aspects of a possible involvement of hydrogen ions in the electrophysiological responses to light of Limulus ventral photoreceptors were investigated. A 1 M solution of either a zwitter-ionic pH buffer or a weakly-buffering control substance was pressure injected through a micropipette into a ventral photoreceptor cell. To estimate the amount injected, 35SO4 was included in the solution. Membrane currents induced by light flashes were measured by a voltage-clamp technique. The buffer-filled micropipette passed current and a 3M KCl filled micropipette monitored membrane voltage. The sensitivity (peak light-induced current/stimulus energy) was measured, after dark adaptation, before and after injection. Injections of buffers, pH 6.3-7.2, to intracellular concentrations of at least 40-200 mM produced only a small mean decrease in sensitivity, approximately equal to that caused by injections of control substances. Excitation, therefore, apparently is not mediated by a change in intracellular pH. Buffers with pH values 5.4-8.4 were also injected. The time to peak of the response depended on pH, being shortened by up to 20% at pH values below 7.7 and lengthened at higher pH values. The time to peak of the response appeared to be shortened by an increase in intracellular pH-buffering capacity even when there was no change in intracellular pH.

6096|t|[Mg, Ca-activated ATP-ase of Pacinian corpuscles].
6096|a|Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activated by Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions was detected in single mechanoreceptors (Pacini's corpuscles) of cat; addition of Ca2+ (10(-5)M) to Mg-ATP-ase increased the activity by the factor of 1.6. The activity optimum of Mg- or Co-ATPase was in the alkaline pH zone. A high substrate specificity of Mg, Ca-ATPase was shown. Parachlorinemercury-benzoate (5muM) considerably reduced the activity of Mg, Ca-ATPase, whereas oubain (10(-5)M) failed to affect it significantly. It is supposed that Mg, Ca-ATPase of Pacini's corpuscles was close to actomyosine -like proteins.

6125|t|Choline acetyltransferase, glutamate decarboxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase in the cochlea and cochlear nucleus of the guinea pig.
6125|a|Activities of choline acetyltransferase (ChAC), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and catecholamines, respectively, were measured in the cochlea and cochlear nucleus of the guinea pig. ChAc activity in the organ of Corti, third turn, was 1270 pmole ACh formed/min/mg protein (ChAc, 1270) and was higher than in turn 4 (ChAc, 543). ChAc activity was higher when the preparation included the inner hair cell region than when not. GAD activity in samples of turn 3 and 4 combined was low, 0.17 nmole GABA formed/min/mg protein (GAD, 0.17). All 3 enzymes were low in auditory nerve: ChAc, 1.7, GAD, 0.10 and TH, 1.0 pmole DOPA formed/min/mg protein. In the cochlear nucleus, the values were: ChAc, 129, GAD, 1.70 and TH, 2.7. The findings on the distribution of ChAc activity in the organ of Corti fit the hypothesis that the olivocochlear nerve fibers are cholinergic. Because of low GAD in the cochlea, GABA is unlikely to be transmitter in the organ of Corti. Similarly, it is unlikely that ACh, GABA or a catecholamine is a transmitter between the auditory nerve and the cochlear nucleus.

6128|t|An evaluation of L-glutamate as the transmitter released from optic nerve terminals of the pigeon.
6128|a|The possibility was investigated that L-glutamic acid is the excitatory transmitter released from the optic nerve terminals of the pigeon optic tectum. (1) Superficial layers of the tectum contained high levels of endogenous glutamate and accumulated L-[3H]glutamate by a high affinity uptake process. (2) Subcellular and autoradiographic studies indicated that 10-30% of the exogenously accumulated L-[3H]glutamate was localized within synaptosomes, and that 11-15% of the synaptosomes had been labelled. (3) The glutamate-accumulating synaptosomes sedimented to the same isopycnic density as pinched-off optic nerve terminals. (4) GABA-and noradrenaline-accumulating synaptosomes were also associated with this subcellular population. (5) Retinal ablation did not change endogenous glutamate concentrations or the high affinity uptake of glutamate. The results are discussed in relation to a possible role for L-glutamate as the 'optic nerve transmitter' and in the context of previous evidence implicating glutamate as an excitatory transmitter.

6131|t|[Respiratory stimulant effect of S 2620 in the dog anesthetized with pentobarbital].
6131|a|In the dog under pentobarbitone anesthesia, the intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg S 2620 is followed by a significant increase in respiratory rate, PaO2 and pHa and by a large decrease in PaCO2. Cervical vagotomy and chemoreceptor denervation reduced and even abolished these effects. They can be induced again by a second intravenous injection or by direct instillation in the fourth ventricle. These results suggest a central action of the drug.

6133|t|Modified 5'-nucleotides resistant to 5'-nucleotidase: isolation of 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine 5'-phosphate and N2, N2-dimethylguanosine 5'-phosphate from snake venom hydrolysates of transfer RNA.
6133|a|A procedure for the quantitative measurement of the O2'-methylnucleoside constitutents of RNA has recently been developed in this laboratory (Gray, M.W. Can. J. Biochem. 53, 735-746 (1975)). This assay method is based on the resistance of O2'-methylnucleoside 5'-phosphates (pNm) (generated by phosphodiesterase hydrolysis of RNA) to subsequent dephosphorylation by venom 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5). In the present investigation, two base-modified 5'-nucleotides, each displaying an unusual resistance to 5'-nucleotidase, have been identified. These compounds have been characterized by a variety of techniques as N2, N2-dimethylguanosine 5'-phosphate (pm2/2G) and 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine 5'-phosphate (p4abu3U). Because of their resistance to 5'-nucleotidase, pm2/2G and p4abu3U are isolated along with the pNm in the mononucleotide fraction of venom hydrolysates of transfer RNA. Under hydrolysis conditions, the stability of p4abu3U is comparable to that of a pNm, allowing quantitative assay of the nucleotide. The proportion (mean +/- SD) of p4abu3U in venom hydrolysates of wheat embryo and Escherichia coli tRNA has been determined to be 0.35 +/- 0.03 (n=5) and 0.14 +/- 0.02 (n=4) mol%, respectively. The absence of p4abu3U in venom hydrolysates of yeast tRNA implies the absence of the corresponding nucleoside in yeast tRNA, in agreement with existing data. The variable recovery of pm2/2G from venom hydrolysates of wheat embryo and yeast tRNA indicates that under hydrolysis conditions, this base-modified nucleotide is only partially resistent to 5'-nucleotidase. The complete absence of pm2/2G in venom hydrolysates of E. coli tRNA is consistent with the known absence of N2, N2-dimethylguanosine in this RNA. These observations demonstrate that resistance to 5'-nucleotidase is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for concluding that a 5'-nucleotide is O2'-methylated. When applied to wheat embryo ribosomal RNA, the analytical methods described in this report failed to reveal any compound having the distinctive charge properties of p4abu3U. It therefore appears that 1-methyl-3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)pseudouridine, recently characterized as a constituent of the 18 S rRNA of Chinese hamster cells (Saponara, A.G. & Enger, M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 349, 61-77 (1974)), may not be present in wheat embryo ribosomal RNA.

6145|t|Effects of Tumor-like assay conditions, lonizing radiation, and hyperthermia on immune lysis of tumor cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.
6145|a|Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL's) harvested from mixed splenic lymphocyte cultures (DBA/2 + C57BL) were tested for their ability to lyse allogeneic P815 mastocytoma cells under various tumor-like assay conditions, with or without previous exposure to ionizing radiation or hyperthermia (43 degrees). There was little or no decrease of immune cytolysis when CTL's were assayed by 51Cr release under tumor-like conditions (plateau-phase target cells, low pH, or anoxia) or after irradiation, but cytolytic activity was greatly reduced when CTL's were exposed to heat; 45 min of hyperthermic treatment decreased activity by greater than or equal to 99% while reducing the apparent cell viability (as indicated by trypan blue exclusion) by only 30%. When the P815 target cells rather than the CTL's were exposed to heat their susceptibility to immune lysis was not affected even after treatment times that were lethal to the tumor cells. Despite the dissimilar heat sensitivities of CTL and P815 cells, the dose-response curves for inhibition of protein synthesis by heat, as indicated by [3H]leucine incorporation, were similar for both cell types: neither the depression of protein synthesis in heated CTL's nor the decreased cytolytic ability of these cells was reversed within 3 hr. When irradiated or heated P815 cells were incubated with CTL's, the resulting survival curves were always additive, indicating that neither irradiation nor heat treatment affected the susceptibility of the tumor cells to immune attack. The extreme heat sensitivity of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes raises important questions about the possible effects of hyperthermic treatment on the immune competence of cancer patients.

6161|t|Effect of timolol versus propranolol on hypertension and hemodynamics.
6161|a|The effect of timolol versus propranolol on hypertension, hemodynamics, and plasms renin activity was evaluated in 20 men. After two weeks of placebo, 11 men received timolol 30 to 60 mg daily, and nine men received propranolol, 240 to 480 mg daily, for five weeks in a double-blind randomized study. The 20 men then received placebo again for two weeks. Right heart catheterization was performed in all 20 patients after two weeks of the first placebo and after five weeks of timolol or propranolol. Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol were equally effective in significantly lowering supine and upright systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate recorded on an outpatient basis. Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar hemodynamic effects including similar significant depression of cardiac index. Equipotent doses of timolol and propranolol caused similar marked depression of plasma renin activity. The hypotensive action of timolol and of propranolol was unrelated to their effect on plasma renin activity.

6164|t|Diazepam abuse: incidence, rapid screening, and confirming methods.
6164|a|We studied 2500 patients suspected to be drug-overdose victims. Blood samples were quantitatively screened for the most commonly abused drugs, including diazepam. Of these, 61% had positive findings, including diazepam in about one of every four. A new rapid, simple, and quantitative gas-chromatographic method for simultaneous analysis of diazepam and sedatives (in two instruments) is described. A single extraction at low pH is used, preserving the balance of the sample to be used for confirming methods via ultraviolet spectrophotometry and thin-layer chromatography. Prevalance of other positive findings is also listed, and findings for diazepam are categorized by age.

6184|t|The ventilatory response in severe metabolic acidosis.
6184|a|1. The ventilatory response to severe metabolic acidosis was studied by measuring arterial blood carbon dioxide tension and pH in sixty-seven patients with blood pH less than 7-10, none of whom had hypercapnia, pulmonary oedema, or chronic pulmonary insufficiency. The results were compared with those previously found in patients with uncomplicated diabetic ketoacidosis. 2. By that comparison, fifty-two of the sixty-seven patients with blood pH less than 7-10 were judged to have "appropriate hypocapnia", and fifteen had "submaximal hypocapnia". Thirteen of the latter fifteen had circulatory failture and/or acute hypoxia, and seven of nine in whom it was measured had plasma lactate greater than 9 mmol/1. 3. Hyperventilation was therefore usually well sustained in these patients with severe metabolic acidosis, except in most of those with acute tissue hypoxia. The latter may have had insufficient time to achieve maximum hyperventilation in response to their acidosis, or perhaps their submaximal hypercapnia presaged imminent failure of the hyperventilatory response.

6272|t|Effect of pH on the transient reduction of pig-plasma benzylamine oxidase by benzylamine derivatives.
6272|a|1. The transient kinetics of reduction of the 470-nm absorption band in benzylamine oxidase by substrate at different pH values between 6 and 10 have been studied by stopped-flow techniques, and substituent effects on kinetic parameters for the reduction process have been examined using a series of ring-substituted benzylamine derivatives as the substrates. 2. Reduction of the enzyme by substrate takes place in two kinetically distinguishable steps, with the intermediate formation of an enzyme-substrate complex in which the substrate appears to be covalently bound through its amino group to the prosthetic group of the enzyme, possibly in the form of an amine-pyridoxal Schiff-base. 3. The apparent stability of the enzyme-substrate complex shows no obvious dependence on the electronic properties of the amine substrates, but is strongly pH-dependent in a way suggesting that substrate-binding involves the non-protonated amines, exclusively, and requires the presence of the acid form of an ionizing group in the enzyme with apparent pKa of 8.8. 4. Reduction of the enzymatic 470-nm chromophore and release of the aldehyde product of the catalytic process are rate-limited by the same monomolecular reaction step involving the enzyme-substrate complex. Rate constants for the rate-limiting reaction exhibit no significant dependence on pH between 6 and 10, but correlate with Hammett sigma-values for the ring-substituted benzylamine derivatives tested, yielding a phi-value of + 0.3.

6274|t|Removal of Mn from spinach chloroplasts by sodium cyanide and the binding of Mn2+ to Mn-depleted chloroplasts.
6274|a|Manganese and copper were released from spinach chloroplasts by NaCN-treatment, though iron was not affected. The Hill reaction activity was also inhibited by this treatment, but was partially recovered by the addition of either Mn2+ or Cu2+, but not of Fe3+. The interaction of Mn2+ with manganese-depleted chloroplasts by NaCN-treatment was studied using 54Mn2+. A Scatchard plot shows the high and low affinity binding sites of Mn2+ on NaCN-treated chloroplast membrane; high affinity binding being specific for NaCN-treated chloroplast with a binding constant, KH, of 1.9 X 10(5) M-1, and a maximum binding number, NH, of 0.0016 g-atom per mole of chlorophyll. The low binding site was also found on untreated chloroplasts; its binding constant, KL, being 1.2 X 10(4) M-1, and its maximum binding number, NL, of 0.0112 g-atom per mole oc chlorophyll at pH 8.2 NH was proportional to the degree of the removal of Mn by NaCN-treatment and was constant at pH 4--9. NL markedly increased at a high pH with a midpoint of pH 7.9 indicating the exposure of a new, similar binding site. Light illumination partially inhibited the binding of Mn2+. Within 1 min in the dark the binding reaction reached equilibrium in the absence of pyrophosphate, however, 20 min were required to transform into pyrophosphate-resistant form. The pH dependence of the binding of Mn2+ with pKa 7.2 and the ineffectiveness of p-chloromercuribenzoate suggest the possible ligand of Mn2+ is the imidazole nitrogen of the histidine residue.

6303|t|[Effect of psychotropic and anticonvulsive preparations on transport ATPase in the renal tubules of the guinea pig].
6303|a|The effect of 4 groups of medicamentous agents, viz. neoruleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, somnifacients and antiepileptics - on the activity of the transport ATPase and p-nitrophenylphosphatase from the renal tubules of the guinea pig was studied. Used in high concentrations neuroleptics suppress almost completely the activity of the enzyme, but in small doses influence but little that of the p-nitrophenylphosphatase. The butyrophenone derivatives have a mild effect upon the activity of the p-nitrophenylphosphatase and in low concentrations they stimulate it. The effect of tricyclic antidepressants closely approaches the one produced by neuroleptics-phenothiazines. Lithium carbonate leaves the enzyme intact. Barbiturates and antiepileptic agents inhibit but feebly these enzymes.

6372|t|Sugar and amino acid transport in animal cells.
6372|a|The molecular basis of intracellular metabolism of nutrients and its control is quite well understood in animal cells. Comparable knowledge about solute entry into cells is still lacking, as, in contrast to metabolism, no chemical reactions seem to be directly associated with the known nutrient transport. Nevertheless, translocations of sugars and amino acids across the plasma membrane are specific and controlled processes, biologically as well as chemically. Recent advances in techniques for isolation of plasma membranes have made it feasible to study transport properties of animal cells without the complications encoutered in viable cells. This approach has been applied to sugar and amino acid transport in plasma membranes of several tissues, and intact transport systems for D-glucose, D-fructose, neutral L-amino acids, and dipeptides have been demonstrated. This demonstration of intact transport systems in an in vitro setting accomplishes the first step in the direction of molecular isolation of transport systems. Furthermore, the information obtained about the transport mechanism catalyzed by some systems has settled controversies on active nutrient transport. For example, electrogenic cotransport of sodium and D-glucose or of sodium and neutral L-amino acids has been shown to form the basis for active, sodium-dependent absorption of these nutrients. A consequence of this type of mechanism is interaction between sugar and amino acid transport via the common charged cosubstrate sodium. Moreover, different types of transport systems for the same substrate have been demonstrated in the luminal and contraluminal regions of the plasma membrane of epithelial cells, which explains unidirectional transepithelial transport. The luminal membrane contains sodium-dependent, active transport systems, and the contraluminal membrane passive, facilitated diffusion systems. In vivo, the lower intracellular sodium potential would result in concentrative nutrient uptake from the lumen, but would not influence exit on the contraluminal side. Variations in the electrical components of the sodium potential, which have not been measured, may explain apparently contradicting results on active sugar and amino acid transport with various tissue preparations.

6420|t|Dual contribution theory of regulation of CSF HCO3 in respiratory acidosis.
6420|a|Regulation of CSF HCO3-in respiratory acidosis was studied in light of the "dual contribution theory," which proposed that there were two sources for the CSF HCO3-increase: 1) HCO3-by diffusion from plasma and 2) HCO3-generated in the CNS and catalyzed by the local carbonic anhydrase (J. Appl. Physiol. 38: 504-512, 1975). In anesthetized dogs with an increase in Paco2 of 30 mmHg for 4 h the plasma HCO3 increased 2 meq/1 and CSF 6 meq/1. In combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis, plasma HCO3-did not increase but CSF HCO3-increased 6 meq/1. In combined acidosis and intraventricular injections of acetazolamide no increase in plasma or CSF HCO3-occurred. In combined respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis and intraventricular acetazolamide, plasma HCO3-increased 15 meq/1 but CSF HCO3-increased 6 meq/1. Brain and CSF ammonia increased linearly and selectively with the increase in the relative contribution of CNS HCO3-increase. Therefore regulation of CSF HCO3-in respiratory acidosis depends on both components of the dual contribution theory, where each component can provide the total CSF HCO3-increase under appropriate experimental conditions. The control mechanism may be sensitive to changes in [H+] on the brain side of the blood-brain barrier.

6421|t|Effects of continuous positive-pressure ventilation in experimental pulmonary edema.
6421|a|We compared the effects of continuous positive-pressure ventilation (CPPV), using 10 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV), on pulmonary extravascular water volume (PEWV) and lung function in dogs with pulmonary edema caused by elevated left atrial pressure and decreased colloid osmotic pressure. The PEWV was measured by gravimetric and double-isotope indicator dilution methods. Animals with high (22-33 mmHg), moderately elevated (12-20 mmHg), and normal (3-11 mmHg) left atrial pressures (Pla) were studied. The PEWV by both methods was significantly increased in the high and moderate Pla groups, the former greater than the latter (P less than 0.05). There was no difference in the PEWV between animals receiving CPPV and those receiving IPPV in both the high and moderately elevated Pla groups. However, in animals with high Pla, the Pao2 was significantly better maintained and the inflation pressure required to deliver a tidal volume of 12 ml/kg was significantly less with the use of CPPV than with IPPV. We conclude that in pulmonary edema associated with high Pla, PEEP does not reduce PEWV but does improve pulmonary function.

6423|t|Polymer membrane sensors for continuous intravascular monitoring of blood pH.
6423|a|A new type of pH sensor suitable for chronic intra-vascular implantation by virtue of its small size, flexibility, and ruggedness was constructed and evaluated. The pH-sensitive element was a thin film of an elastromeric polymer made ion permselective to proteons by adding a lipophilic, specific H+-ion carrier. This was coated onto small diameter silver wires to form sensors. In preliminary trials in anesthetized dogs, the sensors permitted continuous, accurate in vivo blood pH measurement with rapid response (less than 0.1 s).

6453|t|Accleration of autooxidation of human oxyhemoglobin by aniline and its relation to hemoglobin-catalyzed aniline hydroxylation.
6453|a|Changes in the ultraviolet/visible spectrum of human oxyferrohemoglobin upon addition of aniline were indicative of a concentration-dependent interaction of aniline with hemoglobin, resulting in accelerated autooxidation of the hemoprotein. Oxygen was found to markedly inhibit this interaction of aniline with oxyhemoglobin. The dependence of the rate of autooxidation on aniline concentration followed saturation kinetics and showed a half-maximal response at 8 mM aniline. This value is equal to the value of Km for aniline as substrate for the O2-dependent, hemoglobin-catalyzed hydroxylation reaction which yields p-aminophenol (Mieyal, J. J., Ackerman, R.S., Blumer, J.L., and Freeman, L.S. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 3436-3441). Thus, an aniline-oxyhemoglobin complex is implicated in the overall catalytic reaction. No detectable p-aminophenol was formed when aniline was combined with oxyhemoglobin in the absence of an electron donor, but hydroxylation of aniline does occur when NADPH, NADPH plus P-450 reductase, or Na2S2O4 are also added.

6454|t|Regulation of glutaminase B in Escherichia coli. I. Purification, properties, and cold lability.
6454|a|Escherichia coli contains two glutaminases, A and B, with pH optima below pH 5 and above pH 7, respectively. Neither glutaminase A nor B is released from E. coli by osmotic shock. Glutaminase B has been purified 6,000-fold and the purified preparation is estimated to contain about 40% glutaminase B. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 90,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.4. Glutaminase B exhibits a broad pH optimum between 7.1 and 9.0. Only L-glutamine is deamidated by glutaminase B, L-asparagine and D-glutamine are not deamidated. The substrate saturation curve for glutaminase B shows an intermediary plateau region. Like many regulatory enzymes, glutaminase B is cold-labile. The enzyme is inactivated by cooling and activated by warming; both processes are first order with respect to time. The activation energy for activation by warming was calculated to be 5900 cal/mol. Activation by warming increased the Vmax and decreased the S0.5 for L-glutamine, but did not alter the molecular weight of the catalytically active enzyme. Borate and glutamate protected glutaminase B from inactivation by cold.

6468|t|Kinetics of binding of the toxic lectins abrin and ricin to surface receptors of human cells.
6468|a|Kinetic parameters of the interaction of the toxic lectins abrin and ricin with human erythrocytes and HeLa cells have been measured. The binding of 125I-labeled abrin and ricin to human erythrocytes and to HeLa cells at 37 degrees was maximal around pH 7, whereas at 0 degrees the binding was similar over a broad pH range. The binding occurred at similar rates at 0 degrees and 37 degrees with rate constants in the range 0.9 to 3.0 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. The dissociation was strongly temperature-dependent with rate constants in the range 3.4 to 45 X 10(-4) s-1 at 0 degrees and 3.9 to 18 X 10(-3) s-1 at 37 degrees. The presence of unlabeled lectins as well as lactose increased the rate of dissociation. The association constants measured at equilibrium or calculated from the rate constants were between 0.64 X 10(8) M-1 and 8.2 X 10(8) M-1 for abrus lectins, and between 8.0 X 10(6) M-1 and 4.2 X 10(8) M-1 for ricinus lectins. The association constants for the toxins were lower at 37 degrees than at 0 degrees. Isolated ricin B chain appeared to bind with similar affinity as intact ricin. The number of binding sites was estimated to be 2 to 3 X 10(6) per erythrocyte and 1 to 3 X 10(7) per HeLa cell. The binding sites of HeLa cells all displayed a uniform affinity towards abrin and ricin, both at 0 degrees and at 37 degrees. The same was the case with the binding sites of erythrocytes at 0 degrees. However, the data indicated that at 20 degrees erythrocytes possessed binding sites with two different affinities. Only a fraction of the cell-bound toxin appeared to be irreversibly bound and could not be removed by washing with 0.1 M lactose. The fraction of the total amount of bound toxin which became irreversibly bound to HeLa cells was for both toxins about 2 X 10(-3)/min at 37 degrees, whereas no toxin was irreversibly bound at 0 degrees. In the case of erythrocytes no toxin became irreversibly bound, either at 0 degrees or 37 degrees, indicating that the toxins are unable to penetrate into these cells.

6494|t|beta-Adrenergic receptors in rat brain.
6494|a|125I-Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol ([125I] IHYP), a potent beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, has been used to study beta-adrenergic receptors in rat brain. Binding of [125I] IHYP (30 pM) to a membrane fraction min and dissociation took place with a half time of about 16 min. Phentolamine (10(-4) M) decreased non-receptor binding but it had no effect on the binding of [125I] IHYP to beta-adrenergic receptors in cortex, cerebellum or caudate. In the presence of phentolamine specific binding (defined as binding which was blocked by 0.3 muM dl-propranolol) represented 70-85% of total binding. The binding of [125I] IHYP was inhibited by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. d-Stereoisomers were 2-3 orders of magnitude less potent than the corresponding 1-isomers. The denstiy of [125I] IHYP binding sites was studied in membrane fractions from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and caudate nucleus by means of Scatchard analysis. The K(D) of [125I] IHYP was similar in the three regions studied, and the density of [125I] IHYP binding sites was approximately 50% greater in the cortex and caudate than in the cerebellum. The Hill coefficient for the binding of [125I] IHYP to membranes from cerebral cortex was 1.02. The properties of the binding of [125I] IHYP are similar to those which would be expected of binding to beta-adrenergic receptors in vitro.

6594|t|Fine structure of three different anti-fluorescein combining sites: induced circular dichroism of hapten bound to autologous and heterologous recombinants.
6594|a|We have previously reported the sequential appearance in hyperimmunized rabbits of three distinct types of antifluorescein-combining sites that can be distinguished by the characteristic induced circular dichroism (CD) of the bound hapten, fluorescein. Such induced CD depends on the configuration of the surrounding residues, and, in the case of anti-fluorescein, can be localized to the configuration of the sub-site which binds the hydroxyxanthenone moiety of fluorescein. In the present investigation, we have studied the fine structure of both autologous and heterologous recombinant sites and of the free chains by measuring the induced CD of bound hapten. Heavy chain dimers at pH 5.4 bound fluorescein that displayed a weak negative CD band which is different from that observed in any of the native antibodies. No induced CD was observed with light chains. Thus, the hydroxyxanthenone subsite does not exist intact in any of the isolated chains. Fluorescein bound to purified autologous recombinants, when studied at pH 7.5, exhibited CD spectra very similar to those observed for the original antibodies. Most significantly, fluorescein bound to purified heterologous recombinants, prepared in all possible combinations, showed CD spectra most similar to those exhibited by sites from which the heavy chain was derived. Thus, the microenvironment of the subsite appears to be due primarily to the heavy chain.

6613|t|The actions of some putative neurotransmitters on the cockroach salivary gland.
6613|a|1. Certain putative transmitters were applied to the innervated cockroach salivary gland and their effects on the resting potential and the neurally evoked secretory potential of the acinar cells were observed. 2. gamma-Aminobutyric acid, glutamate, glycine, aspartate and alanine had no significant effect on the resting potential. However, gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate reduced the neurally evoked secretory potential but only at concentrations above 10(-3) M3. Acetylcholine and carbachol appeared to act by modifying transmitter output from the salivary nerves. These substances failed to have any effect on the resting potential. 4. The biogenic amines, adrenaline, dopamine, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine and octopamine, produced hyperpolarizing responses, graded according to concentration. 5. It is suggested that dopamine, the most potent of the biogenic amines tested, is the transmitter at this junction.

6615|t|[Characterization of the oxidoreductase inhibitor (author's transl)].
6615|a|The oxidoreductase inhibitor was prepared from NAD in alkaline solution, and purified chromatographically. Investigations are reported on the extinction and fluorescence spectra, stability of the inhibitor, and the dependence of inhibition on the concentration of enzyme and coenzyme. Kinetic studies show that the inhibition is non-competitive.

6632|t|Skeletal muscle necrosis following membrane-active drugs plus serotonin.
6632|a|Administration of imipramine plus serotonin (5-HT) to rats has been proposed as an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We studied the skeletal muscle necrosis produced in male rats given 5-HT after pretreatment with imipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants, or antihistamines, which like the tricyclic antidepressants, can block neuronal reuptake of 5-HT. Following one of these agents plus 5-HT, 20 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.), necrosis was more severe in the soleus muscle than the quadriceps. There was no significant difference in the incidence of necrosis in the soleus and quadriceps muscles following one of these agents plus 5-HT, 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.). After one of these agents plus 5-HT i.p., but not 5-HT s.c., extensive necrosis was significantly more frequent and severe in the quadriceps muscle than after 5-HT s.c. Chlorpheniramine (CP) plus 5-HT, 2.5 mg/kg intravenously, produced less muscle necrosis than CP plus 5-HT s.c. or i.p. The necrosis produced by CP plus 5-HT s.c. was comparable ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection site. The necrosis following CP plus 5-HT i.p. was maximal at 24 hr and remained fairly constant until 5 days. Regeneration was prominent by 7 days. The muscle necrosis produced by CP plus 5-HT is blocked by some 5-HT blockers, e.g., methiotepin and methysergide. It is also partially blocked by denervation. The capacity of tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines to block neuronal 5-HT reuptake tended to be negatively correlated with the capacity to potentiate the muscle necrosis they produced with 5-HT, which suggests that blockade of 5-HT uptake is not the mechanism of the pathology produced by the combined treatment. The tricyclic antidepressants and the antihistamines are "membrane stabilizers-labilizers". Other drugs which are "membrane stabilizers-labilizers" such as trihexyphenidyl and procaine also promoted skeletal muscle necrosis when given prior to 5-HT. It is proposed that the effects of imipramine plus 5-HT on skeletal muscle are not due to the blockade of neuronal uptake of 5-HT and subsequent vascular-induced ischemia, but reflect direct toxic effects of these agents on skeletal muscle.

6640|t|Lysozyme damage caused by secondary degradation products during the autoxidation process of linoleic acid.
6640|a|Autoxidized LA is classified into four groups, LA, LAHPO, SP and FP. Lysozyme is inactivated by these products in the increasing order as follows: FP less than LA less than LAHPO less than SP. The effects of these products on the amino acid composition of lysozyme is examined. All kinds of amino acid residues were not damaged until lysozyme was incubated with LA and LAHPO at 45 degrees C for 100 days. The susceptible amino acid residues attacked by the autoxidized products are tryptophan, lysine and histidine. The specific loss of methionine by SP occurs during acid-hydrolysis. The effect of SP was the strongest among the autoxidized products. FP was almost noneffective. The destructive actions of BP, MA and PA were compared with those of autoxidized products. Effects of these compounds did not resemble those of autoxidized products. It was concluded that tryptophan, lysine and histidine residues were specifically attacked by SP.

6690|t|A sensitive biological assay for prostaglandin E and acetylcholine.
6690|a|Superfused hamster stomach strip has been used in the bioassay of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and acetylcholine. The preparation proved very stable and had no spontaneous movements. The sensitivity to PGE2 (and PGE1) was in the range of 10(-9) g ml(-1) and to acetylcholine 10(-12) g ml(-1). After treatment with physostigmine the sensitivity to acetylcholine was 10(-15) g ml(-1). In acetylcholine determination the preparation is more sensitive than any other method.

6694|t|Some effects of urea on drug dissolution.
6694|a|Solubilities and dissolution rates of salicylic acid have been determined in urea solutions at different pH values. Solubilities increased with pH and urea concentration; a solubilization mechanism was considered to be operating. The solubilization effect of urea was greatest on the non-ionzed moieties of the solute. Dissolution rates of salicylic acid increased with pH and urea concentration. The increase in dissolution rate paralleled increases in solubility. The role of solubilizing effect in the enhancement of dissolution rate by urea is discussed.

6716|t|Tremorine-oxotremorine-induced tremor, hypothermia and analgesia, and physostigmine toxicity, in mice after pretreatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.
6716|a|The beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol, PhQA33 and LB-46 exhibited appreciable activity against tremorine-(TMN) and oxotremorine-(OTMN) induced tremor, whereas pronethalol, (+)-H56/28, (-)-H56/28, Kö-592 and L(+)-INPEA possessed weak action. The two beta-blockers, namely D,L(+/-)-INPEA and D(-)-INPEA acted as weak tremorgens. None of the above compounds suppressed the induced peripheral cholinergic phenomena; or possessed any central anticholinergic activity, as they were unable to afford protection against physostigmine-induced death. Propranolol, PhQA33 and LB-46 antagonized TMN-induced hypothermia and analgesia, but were inactive against OTMN-induced changes. A correlation of the beta-blocking and anti-tremor activity of these agents is unlikely.

6799|t|Localization of calcium binding sites associated with the calcium spike in barnacle muscle.
6799|a|La ion behaves as a competitive inhibitor of Ca ions on the calcium spike in the giant muscle fiber of the barnacle, Balanus nubilus. La-treated muscle fibers, in which the rate of rise of the spike was diminished to a known degree, have been examined with the electron-microscope. In such fibers dense particles are seen in association with the surface membrane and external lamina of the cell. La particles are not seen in association with fibers that have been allowed to recover from La inhibition before fixation. The number of La particles seen in association with the muscle fiber increases with increasing La concentration when the Ca and Mg concentrations are held constant and decreases with increasing Ca and Mg concentration when the La concentration is held constant. The results suggest that the La visible in the electron-microscope under the conditions of these experiments is bound to a class of sites similar to those involved in the Ca spike.

6815|t|A clinical comparison of syrup of ipecac and apomorphine use in adults.
6815|a|A prospective, randomized study was performed to compare syrup of ipecac to apomorphine as the emetic of choice in poisoning cases. Of the 28 adults studied, 15 patients (54%) received 30 ml of ipecac orally and 13 received 0.1 mg/kg apomorphine subcutaneously. Emesis was successfully induced with initial therapy in 13 of 15 (87%) ipecac-treated patients and 10 of 13 (77%) apomorphine-treated patients. In the ipecac group the mean latency period before onset of vomiting was 11.6 minutes (range 4 to 26 min) and in the apomorphine group, 5.3 minutes (range 2 to 13 min) (P less than .01). In the ipecac group, one patient suffered moderate central nervous system (CNS) depression. No hypotension or respiratory depression was observed in this group. In the apomorphine group significant CNS depression developed in eight patients (62%), hypotension developed in five (38%) and respiratory depression in one. There was no consistent relationship between type of poison ingested and occurrence of side effects.

6909|t|Methylmalonic aciduria without vitamin B12 deficiency in an adult sibship.
6909|a|Two brothers 62 and 70 years old, without evidence of vitamin B12 lack, excreted 12 to 115 mg of methylmalonic acid daily (normal, less than 9 mg per day). Neither had anemia or hepatic dysfunction, and serum vitamin B12 concentrations ranged from 369 to 800 pg per milliliter. The propositus, the younger brother, continued to excrete excessive methylmalonate, 103 to 115 mg per day, after 2000 mug of parenterally administered vitamin B12 at the fifth and 11th months of study. Leukocyte activities of the cobalamin-linked enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase were respectively reduced in the propositus and his brother, to 0.04 and 0.11 nmoles of 3-(14)-C Ls methylmalonyl coenzyme A metabolized per hour per milligram of leukocyte protein (normal, 0.286 +/- 0.079 [S.D.]). These activities were not enhanced by 2 mug of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin added to the assays. A heritable benign form of adult methylmalonic aciduria rather than vitamin B12 lack best explains these findings.

6918|t|Different alpha-adrenoreceptors in the central nervous system mediating biochemical and functional effects of clonidine and receptor blocking agents.
6918|a|The influence of clonidine on alpha-adrenoreceptors in the central nervous system of rats and mice has been investigated. Both functional events due to postsynaptic receptor stimulation (flexor reflex activity, motor activity) and biochemical changes have been considered. 1. Clonidine was less potent in stimulating the hindlimb flexor reflex activity of spinal rats than in inhibiting the alpha-methyltyrosine-induced disappearance of noradrenaline in the spinal cord and in the whole brain of rats. 2. The increase in flexor reflex activity due to clonidine (0.4 mg/kg) was virtually completely inhibited by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) and haloperidol (10 mg/kg), was partially inhibited by yohimbine (10 mg/kg) and piperoxan (60 mg/kg) and was not significantly inhibited by yohimbine (3 mg/kg) and tolazoline (50 mg/kg). 3. The potentiation by clonidine of the apomorphine-induced locomotor stimulation of reserpine-treated mice was almost completely inhibited by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) but was not significantly affected by yohimbine (10 or 3 mg/kg) and only slightly inhibited by tolazoline (50 mg/kg). 4. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) caused a considerable inhibition of the alpha-methyltyrosine-induced disappearance of noradrenaline in the spinal cord and brain or rats and in the brain of mice. This effect of clonidine was completely antagonized by yohimbine (10 mg/kg). It was markedly antagonized by yohimbine (3 mg/kg), piperoxan (60 mg/kg) or tolazoline (50 mg/kg) but not by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg) or haloperidol (10 mg/kg). 5. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) caused an inhibition of the accumulation of Dopa after decarboxylase inhibition in the noradrenaline-rich regions of the rat central nervous system. This effect was counteracted by yohimbine (10 mg/kg), piperoxan (60 mg/kg) or tolazoline (50 mg/kg) but not by phenoxybenzamine (20 mg/kg). 6. The postsynaptic functional effects and the biochemical effects of clonidine may be due to stimulation of different alpha-adrenoreceptors since the two effects were inhibited differently by various alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agents and since the two effects were produced by different doses of clonidine. The alpha-adrenoreceptors mediating the biochemical changes might be located on the noradrenergic neurones.

6963|t|Markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme in lymph nodes containing non-necrotizing granulomas in sarcoidosis.
6963|a|Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by the generalized formation of granulomas and is accompanied by elevation in the serum in less than half the patients of angiotensin converting enzyme, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the pressor octapeptide, angiotensin II, and L-histidyl-L-leucine. Mean activity of angiotensin converting enzyme was elevated generally more than 10-fold in granuloma-containing lymph nodes, but not in lung in which normally it is abundant, in 19 of 20 patients with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme in lymph nodes from subjects with sarcoidosis was similar to the enzyme from normal lung and lymph node with respect to activity as a function of pH, inhibition of activity by EDTA and o-phenanthroline, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and requirement for chloride for activity, but appeared to be more heat labile. The data suggest that the granulomas in sarcoidosis may be the source of the elevated serum enzyme and that cells of the granulomas, particularly the epitheloid cells which appear by electron microscopy to have active protein biosynthesis, may be actively synthesizing the enzyme.

7156|t|Flunitrazepam, a new benzodiazepine compound in general anaesthesia. Clinical and statistical considerations on the first thousand cases.
7156|a|Flunitrazepam, a derivative of benzodiazepine was used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in 933 patients. The induction dose was from 1,786 to 2,053 mg. The total dose of 2-2.66 mg was sufficient for maintenance of hypnosis for about 2 hours. The undesirable side effects were very rare. The average time of hypnosis after a single dose of flunitrazepam was 50.1 sec. The sedative action of the drug lasted for some time after regaining of consciousness. In most patients there was no need for administration of analgetics during first 24 hours after the operation. The authors believe that surgical anaesthesia will greatly benefit from this drug.

7163|t|[Combination of R3365 (piritramide) and dehydrobenzperidol in animals. Respiratory effects and analgesia].
7163|a|1 -- Respiratory depression has been studied in the no anaesthetized rabbit by analysis of the blood gases after an injection of Piritramide (R 3365) and dehydrobenzperidol. 2 -- The respiratory depression induced by Piritramide alone is less important after an injection of dehydrobenzperidol; the most interessant cases are: -- mixture dehydrobenzperidol 400 mug/kg. Pirittramide 1000 mug/kg; --dehydrobenzperidol (400 mug/kg) injected 15 minutes before Piritramide (1000 mug/kg). 3 -- The addition of Dehydrobenzperidol does not take the analgesic activity of Piritramide decrease by it increases it.

7174|t|Spirometric comparison of carbuterol and isoproterenol aerosol therapy in bronchial asthma. A double blind, matched-pair study of 28 adults and a double blind crossover study of 18 children.
7174|a|Two adrenergic aerosols were compared in a double blind, matched-pair study of 6 months' duration in 28 adult patients with chronic bronchial asthma, and in a double blind, crossover, short-term study in 18 children with severe asthma. In the adult study, one member of each pair was given either 150 mug of isoproterenol or 200 mug of carbuterol 4 times per day, by inhalation, for 6 months. In the childhood study, 18 children, 6 to 12 years of age, with moderate to severe asthma were studied in a double blind, crossover therapeutic trial in which high or low doses of aerosolized carbuterol or isoproterenol were given 4 times daily for 5 days each. Treatment results were evaluated by measuring forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, and maximal mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%) at regulat intervals before and after administration of the respective test drugs. In the adult study, there was a significant difference between carbuterol and isoproterenol for forced vital capacity (P less than 0.02), for 1-sec forced expiratory volume (P less than 0.02), and for FEF25-75% (P less than 0.01) in favor of carbuterol. In the pediatric study, the difference between carbuterol and isoproterenol was significant (P less than 0.05) only for the FEF25-75% on the fifth day of treatment with the high dose administration of carbuterol. There was no associated toxicity of either drug with respect to electrocardiogram, blood chemistry, or subjective complaints. Tachyphylaxis (tolerance with time) to isoproterenol appeared to develop in one patient.

7215|t|Further evidence for the transmission of Mansonella ozzardi by Simulium amazonicum in Brazil.
7215|a|The transmission of Mansonella ozzardi was studied in two rubber collecting villages on the River Purus, state of Amazonas, Brazil. Haematophagous insects were collected from human and bovine baits during the day and night: 687 Mansonia amazonensis and 154 Culicoides sp. indet. were free from infection with M. ozzardi. The former species is probably not a vector, but the low numbers of culicoides dissected preclude any determination of its vector status. Thirty-five (0-99%) of 3530 Simulium amazonicum dissected were found naturally infected with larvae of M. ozzardi. Two hundred and ninety-nine M. amazonensis and 280 S. amazonicum were experimentally infected with M. ozzardi by feeding on volunteers. Microfilariae were detected in the blood meals of both species but no developing larvae were found in the thoracic muscles of M. amazonensis, confirming its non-vector status; 7-1% of the S. amazonicum dissected had filarial larvae in the thorax. There was a statistically significant difference between this rate and the natural rate of infection in this region, verifying that penetration of the thoraric muscles by M. ozzardi had occurred in the experimental infection. The data confirm the observation of Cerqueira (1959) that S. amazonicum transmits M. ozzardi in Brazil.

7223|t|Efficacy of two minor tranquilizers in relieveing symptoms of functional gastrointestinal distress.
7223|a|Two minor tranquilizers, diazepam and lorazepam were significantly better than a placebo preparation in relieving symptoms of functional gastrointestinal distress in 28 patients who took part in a double-blind cross-over trial. The beneficial therapeutic effect may be group- rather than preparation-specific. Both agents were also of significant benefit to the sub-group of patients with aerophagy as a major symptom.

7290|t|N-(1-pyrene)maleimide: a fluorescent cross-linking reagent.
7290|a|N-(1-Pyrene)maleimide is nonfluorescent in aqueous solution but forms strongly fluorescent adducts with sulfhydryl groups of organic compounds or proteins. The conjugation reactions of N-(1-pyrene)maleimide are relatively fast and can be monitored by the increase in fluorescence intensity of the pyrene chromophore. In cases where primary amino groups are also present in the system, we have observed a red shift of the emission spectra of the fluorescent adducts subsequent to the initial conjugation, as characterized by the disappearance of three emission peaks at 376, 396, and 416 nm, and the appearance of two new peaks at 386 and 405 nm. Model studies with N-(1-pyrene)maleimide adducts of L-cysteine and cysteamine indicate that the spectral shift is the result of an intramolecular aminolysis of the succinimido ring in the adducts. Evidence from both chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the addition products supports this reaction scheme. N-(1-Pyrene)maleimide adducts of N-acetyl-L-cysteine and beta-mercaptoethanol, which have no free amino group, do not exhibit a spectral shift. Among several protein conjugates only the N-(1-pyrene)maleimide adduct of bovine serum albumin (PM-BSA) shows the spectral shift resembling that of PM-cysteine. N-(1-Pyrene)maleimide reacts with the sulfhydryl group of the single cysteine residue at position 34 in BSA. The finding that the alpha-amino group of the N-terminus in PM-BSA is blocked after the spectral shift is completed strongly suggests that N-(1-pyrene)maleimide cross-links the N-terminus and the cysteine residue in BSA. The relative proximity of the sulfhydryl and amino groups is very critical in the cross-linking as demonstrated by the observation that the spectral shift observed with PM-BSA can be prevented by addition of denaturing reagents such as 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate immediately after labeling, and by the failure of PM-glutathione to undergo the intramolecular aminolysis. Since the intramolecular rearrangement of PM adducts is associated with characteristic fluorescence changes, N-(1-pyrene)maleimide can serve as a fluorescent cross-linking reagent which provides information about the spatial proximity of sulfhydryl and amino groups in proteins.

7299|t|Involvement of a single hydroxylase species in the hydroxylation of palmitate at the omega-1, omega-2 and omega-3 positions by a preparation from Bacillus megaterium.
7299|a|A soluble enzyme preparation from Bacillus megaterium, requiring NADPH and O2 for activity and containing ferredoxin-replaceable and cytochrome P-450-type components, was previously shown to catalyze the conversion of palmitic acid to an isomeric mixture of omega-1, omega-2 and omega-3 hydroxypalmitate. It has now been shown that the ratio of these three positional isomers in the enzymatic product remains unchanged in spite of partial diminution of total hydroxylase activity by heat treatment, pH change or inhibition by p-hydroxy-mercuribenzoate or carbon monoxide. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that a single hydroxylase with one substrate binding site is responsible for hydroxylation at all three positions of palmitate.

7313|t|pH dependence of 13C-15N coupling constants of highly 14N-enriched amino acids isolated from mass cultivation of algae.
7313|a|The alga Ankistrodesmus braunii was grown with [14N]nitrate under optimized conditions of a large-scale mass cultivation. 19.7% of the dried algae were isolated as a mixture of amino acids. The 15N-labelled amino acids (15N content up to 98%) were separated by ion exchange chromatography using pyridine acetate gradients. The 15N cotent of the analytically pure amino acid was determined by combined gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of the trifluoroacetylated methylesters and by emission spectroscopy in the 15N analysator. Using pulse Fourier transform 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, the pH dependence of the 13C-15N coupling constants of Asp, Pro, Ser, Glu, Gly, Ala, Val, Ile and Leu was determined in aqueous solutions. Increasing coupling constants were found with pH and decreasing electron density, respectively. The relation of Binsch et al. (Binsch, G., Lambert, J.B., Roberts, B.W. and Roberts, J.D. (1964) J.Am. Chem. Soc. 86,5564-5570) between the coupling constant and the product of the S-part of the 13C and 15N hybridization SC - SN = 80 - J (13C-45X) fits best in acidic medium. The magnitude of coupling constants correlates well with the electron densities calculated by Del Re et al. (Del Re, G., Pullman, B. and Yonezawa, T. (1963) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 75, 153-182). The recording of 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra over the entire pH range revealed no change in the sign of the 13C-15N coupling constants of the amino acids.

7323|t|Primary reactions of photosystem II at low pH. 2. Light-induced changes of absorbance and electron spin resonance in spinach chloroplasts.
7323|a|The effects of lowering the pH on Photosystem II has been studied by measuring changes in absorbance and electron spin resonance in spinach chloroplasts. At pH values around 4 a light-induced dark-reversible chlorophyll oxidation by Photosystem II was observed. This chlorophyll is presumably the primary electron donor of system II. At pH values between 5 and 4 steady state illumination induced an ESR signal, similar in shape and amplitude to signal II, which was rapidly reversed in the dark. This may reflect the accumulation of the oxidized secondary donor upon inhibition of oxygen evolution. Near pH 4 the rapidly reversible signal and the stable and slowly decaying components of signal II disappeared irreversibly concomitant with the release of bound manganese. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of low pH on prompt and delayed fluorescence reported earlier (van Gorkom, H.J., Pulles, M.P.J., Haveman, J. and den Haan, G.A. (1976) Biochim. Biophys, Acta 423, 217-226).

7337|t|The effects of pentobarbitone and pethidine on foetal breathing movements in sheep.
7337|a|1 Small doses of pentobarbitone (4 mg/kg i.v.) administered to sheep in the last third of pregancy had little overt effect on the mothers. In the foetus they caused arrest of breathing movements, an alteration in the character of the electrocorticogram and cardiovascular changes which varied with gestational age. 2 In contrast, relatively large doses of pethidine (100-200 mg) admininstered to the mother had no consistent effect on normal foetal breathing movements, though they abolished the foetal response to hypercapnia. 3 The results are discussed in relation to feotal sleep state.

7347|t|Pain as a major cause of postoperative nausea.
7347|a|The incidence of nausea in relation to pain was recorded in 104 patients after abdominal operations. Ten per cent of the patients had episodes of nausea not related to pain. One hundred and fourteen episodes of concomitant pain and nausea were recorded in 61 patients (58.6 per cent). The intravenous injection of morphine or ketobemidone relieved nausea as well as pain in 80 per cent of the episodes. Relief of pain with persistence of nausea was uncommon and if pain relief was inadequate nausea was unabated. Nausea was provoked by 3.4 per cent of the morphine injections, but all patients tolerated similar doses of morphine on other occasions without nausea. Nausea often accompanies pain in the early postoperative period and can be relieved concomitant with the pain by the intravenous use of opiates in adequate doses in a high proportion of cases.

7352|t|Radiation-induced xerostomia in cancer patients. Effect on salivary and serum electrolytes.
7352|a|Saliva and serum electrolyte concentrations were monitored in 30 patients given a course of xerostomia-producing cancer radiotherapy. The mean flow rate of stimulated whole saliva decreased 83.3% during a 6-week treatment period. The striking reduction in saliva output was accompanied by significant increases in saliva Na+, Cl-, Ca++, Mg++ and Prot.- concentrations and by a decrease in saliva HCO3- content. The xerostomic saliva was more concentrated and had a greater salinity than the pretreatment saliva in each instance. In contrast, none of the serum electrolytes measured was significantly altered by the subtotal salivary shutdown.

7373|t|Plasma levels and effects of metoprolol on blood pressure, adrenergic beta receptor blockade, and plasma renin activity in essential hypertension.
7373|a|The effects of metoprolol, a selective beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, on blood pressure, beta receptor blockade (antagoinst of isoproterenol and exercise tachycardia), and plasma renin activity (PRA) have been compared with those of placebo in 16 patients with essential hypertension. The dose of metroprolol was 25 mg three times daily for 1 wk and thereafter 100 mg three times daily for 5 wk. The mean decrease in blood pressure during treatment with metoprolol was 24 +/- 3.8 (SEM)/10 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the lying position and 23 +/- 4.4/9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg after 1 min in the standing position. At a dose of 2.9 to 5.4 mg/kg, steady-state plasma concentrations of metoprolol varied 17-fold (from 20 to 341 ng/ml) between patients and correlated with the interindividual variability in isoproterenol antagonism (r = 0.58, p less than 0.05) and decrease in exercise tachycardia (r = 0.65, p less than 0.01). By contrast, neither of these variables correlated with the dose of metoprolol in mg/kg. Metoprolol decreased PRA by 67 +/- 1.9 and 71 +/- 1.2% in the lying and standing positions, respectively. The decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure in the lying position was significantly correlated to the PRA during the placebo period (r = 0.61, p less than 0.05) but not to the plasma steady-state levels of metoprolol, the degree of beta receptor blockade, and the decrease in PRA.

7374|t|Effects of prazosin in patients with hypertension.
7374|a|A double-blind placebo crossover trail (2 periods, each of 6 wk) was carried out in 12 patients. In the first period the patients were randomly allocated to either their individual established dose of prazosin or to the same number of placebo tablets; treatment was reversed after 6 wk. Blood pressure was higher by 17/8 mm Hgin the lying posture and by 24/14 mm Hg in the standing posture during placebo than during prazosin treatment. Standing pulse rate and body weight were higher and plasma renin activity lower during prazosin treatment. Postural hypotension occurring 1 to 2 hr after the first few doses was noted in one third of the patients when they resumed prazosin treatment after the placebo course.

7446|t|Prolactin-releasing and release-inhibiting factor activities in the bovine, rat, and human pineal gland: in vitro and in vivo studies.
7446|a|The effects of crude extracts of bovine, rat, and human pineal glands on prolactin (PRL) release were studied using an in vitro system. In addition, the effects of a known pineal constituent, arginine vasotocin (AVT), and crude bovine pineal extract (bPE) on PRL secretion were studied in vivo. Normal male rat hemipituitaries (HP), incubated with bPE (13 mg tissue/HP)released 200%, 150%, and 285% more PRL into the medium than did their corresponding untreated control halves incubated in either Medium 199 alone, hypothalamic extract, or cerebral cortical extract, respectively. HP incubated with either rat (6 mg of tissue/HP) or human (25 mg of tissue/HP) pineal extract released 110% and 75% more PRL, respectively, than did their corresponding untreated control halves. HP exposed to 10 mg tissue eq of either bovine pineal fraction A1 or bovine pineal fraction A3 released 88% and 63%, respectively, less PRL than did their corresponding untreated control halves incubated in Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) medium. Quantitites of melatonin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), or estrogen, comparable to those found in the pineal, had no significant effect on PRL secretion in vitro. The iv injection of either bPE (90 mg tissue/rat) or AVT (10 mug/rat) into estrogen and progesterone-treated male rats resulted in a 40% and 138% increase, respectively, in plasma PRL titers, 10 min after injection, over pre-injection control levels. The per cent of increase in plasma PRL levels in these animals was significantly greater than that observed in control rats receiving either saline or cortical extract. The results suggest that crude extracts of pineal glands of three different species contain prolactin-releasing factor (PRF) activity which is probably not due to any endogenous melatonin, TRH, or estrogen that may be present. Conversely, two bovine pineal fractions, A1 and A3, appeared to exhibit prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF) activity. We have concluded that the pineal gland may serve as an alternate or supplemental source of PRF and/or PIF.

7454|t|Enzymic synthesis of lignin precursors. Purification and properties of a cinnamoyl-CoA: NADPH reductase from cell suspension cultures of soybean (Glycinemax).
7454|a|A cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of substituted cinnamoyl-CoA thiol esters to the corresponding cinnamaldehydes was isolated from cell suspension cultures of soybean (Glycine max L. var. Mandarin). A 1660-fold purification of the enzyme was achieved by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite and Sephadex G-100 and affinity chromatography on 5'-AMP-Sepharose. The apparent molecular weight of the reductase was found to be about 38 000 on the basis of the elution volume from a Sephadex G-100 column. Maximum rate of reaction was observed between pH 6.0 and 6.2 in 0.1-0.2 M citrate buffer at 30 degrees C. The enzyme was markedly inhibited by thiol reagents. The reductase showed a high degree of specificity for cinnamoyl-CoA esters. Feruloyl-CoA was the substrate with the lowest Km value (73 muM) and highest V (230 nkat/mg) followed by 5-hydroxy-feruloyl-CoA, sinapoyl-CoA, p-coumaroyl-CoA, caffeoyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA. No reaction took place with acetyl-CoA. The Km value for NADPH varied with the type of substrate. Km values of 28, 120, and 290 muM were found with feruloyl-CoA, sinapoyl-CoA, and p-coumaroyl-CoA, respectively. The rate of reaction observed with NADH was only about 5% of that found with NADPH. The reaction products CoASH and NADP+ inhibited the reaction. The Ki values were in the range of 0.5-1 mM and the inhibition was of a noncompetitive (mixed) type. The role of the reductase in the biosynthesis of lignin precursors is discussed.

7458|t|Glycosidases of molluscs. Purification and properties of alpha-L-fucosidase from Chamelea gallina L.
7458|a|An alpha-L-fucosidase had been purified approximately 300-fold from the liver (hepatopancreas) of the marine mollusc Chamelea gallina L. (= Venus gallina L.). During the different steps of the purification procedure it was difficult to remove the contaminant N-acetylglucosaminidase activity; but, after electrofocusing, a final preparation free of this and other glycosidades present in the crude extract was obtained. The purified enzyme has a broad specificity; it hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl alpha-L-fucoside and natural substrates such as oligosaccharides containing fucosidic residues with alpha 1--2, alpha 1--3 and alpha 1--4 linkages; also it hydrolyzes fucose-containing glycopeptides, such as thyroglobulin glycopeptide, and glycoproteins as procine submaxillary mucin (previously rendered free of sialic acid). The enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.2 +/- 0.2, with a Km of 7 X 10(-5) M using p-nitrophenyl L-fucoside as substrate. It is inhibited by Hg2+ and some sugars, and activated by CN-, Zn2+, Ca2+ and EDTA. It shows two peaks by isoelectric focusing (at 6.3 and 6.6). The molecular weight of the alpha-L-fucosidase by gel filtration was over 2000000.

7535|t|Effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on bone-marrow function in normal and sublethally irradiated mice. I. The effect of isoproterenol on cAMP content in bone-marrow cells in vivo and in vitro.
7535|a|The effect of isoproterenol (IPR) on bone-marrow cAMP content was investigated in vivo and in vitro. In unirradiated CFW mice, the bone-marrow cAMP content was found to be elevated by the administration of noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoproterenol. After IPR administration, the increase in cAMP was biphasic with maxima at 1 and 15 min. An increase in cAMP content was also noted in bone-marrow of sublethally-irradiated mice, but no further increase was observed 15 min after the administration of IPR. Elevation of cAMP by either IPR or radiation was prevented by pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent--propranolol. IPR was also effective in increasing the cAMP content when added to suspension of bone-marrow cells. This effect was abolished by propranolol. IPR did not increase cAMP levels in bone-marrow cells isolated from irradiated animals. The results suggest that the differentiated bone-marrow cells have beta-adrenergic receptors.

7557|t|Studies on alpha-amylase from a thermophilic bacterium. II. Thermal stability of the thermophilic alpha-amylase.
7557|a|The effect of pH, mental ions, and denaturing reagents on the thermal stability of thermophilic alpha-amylase [EC 3.2.1.1] were examined. The enzyme was most stable at around pH 9.2, which is coincident with the isoelectric point of the enzyme. The stability of the enzyme was increased by the addition of calcium, strontium, and sodium ions. The addition of calcium ions markedly stabilized the enzyme. The protective effects of calcium and sodium ions were additive. At room temperature, no detectable destruction of the helical structure of the enzyme was observed after incubation for 1 hr in the presence of 1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine-HC1. The addition of 8 M urea or 6 M guanidine-HC1 lowered the thermal denaturation temperature of the enzyme. The enzyme contained one atom of tightly bound intrinsic calcium per molecule which could not be removed by electrodialysis unless the enzyme was denatured. The rate constants of inactivation and denaturation reactions in the absence and presence of calcium ions were measured and thermodynamic parameters were determined. The presence of calcium ions caused a remarkable decrease in the activation entropy.

7558|t|Activation process of pepsinogen.
7558|a|The activation process of pepsinogen was analyzed by a combination of computer simulation and experiment. In order to investigate in detail the behavior of the basic schemes proposed in the previous study, further computer simulations were conducted. Some experiments were performed based on the information obtained. The changes in the UV difference spectrum in the early stage was measured by the stopped-flow technique and the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin [EC 3.4.23.1] was followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, on the basis of the experimental results, the most reasonable scheme was selected and modified. As a result, a scheme for the activation process of pepsinogen was obtained (Scheme 8). On the basis of the above analyses, it was assumed that the first step and the third step are pH-dependent based on the change in the UV spectrum, that the second step is a nonlinear reaction containing a looped reaction with a dimeric intermediate (in this step, peptide fragments are released and pepsinogen is converted to a pepsin-like molecule), and that the third step is an equilibrium reaction involving proton binding.

7575|t|Determinants of lung bacterial clearance in normal mice.
7575|a|The determinants of the lung clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were studied in normal mice after exposure to an aerosol of viable bacteria and 99mTc-labeled dead bacteria. The fraction of bacteria in lungs that remained viable 4 h after exposure were: S. pneumoniae, 7.3%; K. pneumoniae, 121%; E. coli, 88.5%; S. aureus, 27.6%. The rate of physical removal of bacterial particles (Kmc) was determined from the change in lung 99mTc counts with time: Kmc ranged between 7 and 12%/h and and was similar in all species. The rate of mucociliary clearance and of intrapulmonary bacterial killing (Kk + Kmc) was calculated from the change in bacterial counts with time in animals that had received tetracycline to inhibit bacterial multiplication. Kk, the rate of intrapulmonary killing, was obtained by subtraction of Kmc from (Kk + Kmc). The calculated values for Kk were: S. pneumoniae, - 87%/h; K. pneumoniae, - 17%/h; E. coli, - 18%/h; S. aureus, - 22%/h. The rate of intrapulmonary bacterial multiplication (Kg) was estimated from the relationship of bacterial counts in tetracycline and nontetracycline-treated animals, assuming that tetracycline altered only Kg. Kg, expressed as the doubling time, was: S. pneumoniae, 310 min; K. pneumoniae, 217 min; E.coli, 212 min; S. aureus, infinity (no multiplication). The data indicate that the marked differences in the clearance of these species from the normal mouse lung result from the interaction of differing rates of in vivo bacterial multiplication and killing.

7754|t|Lack of correlation between changes in cyclic nucleotides and subsequent induction of tyrosine hydroxylase in rat adrenal medulla.
7754|a|Pretreatment of rats with dexamethasone (2.5 mumol/kg, a dose which blocks the release of ACTH from the pituitary gland) abolished the reserpine mediated increase in cAMP and the increase in the cAMP/cGMP ratio in the adrenal medulla. In contrast, the reserpine-mediated induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) remained unchanged. Hypophysectomy had a similar effect to dexamethasone treatment. Since changes in cAMP and changes in the cAMP/cGMP ratio are not indispensible prerequisities for the subsequent induction of TH, a causal relationship between the two phenomena seems to be excluded.

7985|t|[Complete parenteral alimentation after major digestive surgery using lEB 51-Trivé 1000].
7985|a|The aim of this work is to study the tolerance and the effectiveness of a complete intravenous feeding with EB 51 - Trivemil in immediate post-operative period, in 40 patients undergoing major digestive surgery. The patients were divided into three groups:--first group: 25 patients were given daily an average of 2900 calories 1500 of which via the Trivemil, during the first four post-operative days.--Second group: 5 patients received the same daily caloric dose but because of local complications, drips were maintained until the 7th day.--Third group: 10 patients received an average of 3100 calories daily 2000 of which via the Trivemil. The tolerance was evaluated by a clinical observation (blood pressure - nausea - cutaneous manifestations - temperature) and by a biological observation (hemolysis - free hemoglobin - plasma clearing). The use and effectiveness of the nutrient was evaluated - globally - by a study of body weight according to the hydro-electrolytic balance and then - individually - by the balance of the intakes and secretions of the glucides, lipids and proteids. The tolerance was excellent in all the cases, the weight remained stable, the nitrogen retention was constant mainly in the third group where it seemed to depend on the initial total energetic intake.

8016|t|Marrow transplantation in treatment of children with aplastic anaemia or acute leukaemia.
8016|a|Seventy-six patients, aged 2 to 17 years, were treated with bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anaemia or acute leukaemia refractory to conventional therapy. 16 of the 22 patients (73%) who received marrow transplantations for aplastic anaemia are surviving, 12 of these for over one year. In acute leukaemia, using preparation with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation, 8 of 33 patients (24%) receiving allogeneic and 5 of 8 (63%) receiving syngeneic transplantations are continuing in remission from 3 months to beyond 2 years. The longest continuing remission off therapy is now over 4 1/2 years after preparation with total body irradiation. The major causes of failure remain graft-versus-host disease, infection, graft rejection (aplastic anaemia), and leukaemic relapse.

8040|t|The effects of proteolytic digestion by trypsin on the structure and catalytic properties of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase from bovine heart mitochondria.
8040|a|1. At 21 degrees C incubation of NADH-ubiquinone-1 reductase (Complex 1) with trypsin caused selective inhibition of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase activity. The reduction of K3Fe(CN)6 by NADH or NADPH was unaffected, but a slow decrease in the rate of reduction of ubiquinone-1 by NADH was observed. 2. The pH-dependence of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase activity differed in Complex I and trypsin-treated Complex I. The trypsin-labile activity had a pH optimum of approx. 6.5, whereas the trypsin-resistant activity had a pH optimum of approx. 5.5 or less. 3. The trypsinlabile transhydrogenase activity was specifically inhibited by butanedione or phenylglyoxal and was identified with the enzyme catalysing energy-linked transhydrogenase activity in submitochondrial particles. 4. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate revealed that trypsin caused degradation of a polypeptide of mol.wt 20500 in parallel with the loss of transhydrogenase activity. 5. At 30 degrees C and higher trypsin concentrations, the rate of reduction of K3Fe(CN)6 by NADH or NADPH slowly decreased. Increased lability of NADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity to trypsin was observed when the endogenous phospholipid of Complex I was depleted by detergent or phospholipase A treatment. 6. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis indicated that removal of phospholipid allowed much more extensive degradation of constituent polypeptides by trypsin. The subunits of the low-molecular-weight (type II) dehydrogenase (53000 and 26000 mol.wt.) were, however, relatively resistant to trypsin even in phospholipid-depleted preparations.

8063|t|Effects of some benzodiazepine derivatives on Triton WR-1339-Induced hyperlipidaemia in rats.
8063|a|Oral administration of the benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, bipotassium chlorazepate) in Triton WR-1339-induced (200 mg/kg, blood collection 18 h later) hyperlipidaemia in rats elicited marked decrease of serum total lipids, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and alterations in free fatty acid and free glycerol content. The optimal doses for diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide and bipotassium chlorazepate were estimated to be 5 mg/kg. Other benzodiazepines, namely oxazepam, medazepam and nitrazepam, elicited only minor changes in serum lipids levels, while with grandaxin no change was observed. The optimal doses of diazepam and lorazepam brought about the same changes in serum lipid content as did clofibrate (90 mg/kg, p. o.). If diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide and bipotassium chlorazepate were administered in doses of 5 mg/kg in Triton WR-1339-treated rats (blood collection taken 3 h later), a significant decrease of total lipids and triglyceride levels was observed. The free glycerol level only altered after the administration of chlordiazepoxide, which brought about a significant reduction.

8070|t|Salmefamol and Salbutamol in exercise-induced asthma in children.
8070|a|A double-blind controlled study is reported of salmefamol 200 mug and salbutamol 200 mug administered by aerosol before exercise tests in asthmatic children. Both drugs prevented exercise-induced asthma. There was no significant difference between them.

8077|t|Energetics of primary processes in visula escitation: photocalorimetry of rhodopsin in rod outer segment membranes.
8077|a|A sensitive technique for the direct calorimetric determination of the energetics of photochemical reactions under low levels of illumination, and its application to the study of primary processes in visula excitation, are described. Enthlpies are reported for various steps in the bleaching of rhodopsin in intact rod outer segment membranes, together with the heats of appropriate model reactions. Protonation changes are also determined calorimetrically by use of buffers with differing heats of proton ionization. Bleaching of rhodopsin is accompanied by significant uptake of heat energy, vastly in excess of the energy required for simple isomerization of the retinal chromophore. Metarhodopsin I formation involves the uptake of about 17 kcal/mol and no net change in proton ionization of the system. Formation of metarhodopsin II requires an additional energy of about 10 kcal/mol and involves the uptake on one hydrogen ion from solution. The energetics of the overall photolysis reaction, rhodopsin leads to opsin + all-trans-retinal, are pH dependent and involve the exposure of an additional titrating group on opsin. This group has a heat of proton ionization of about 12 kcal/mal, characteristic of a primary amine, but a pKa in the region of neutrality. We suggest that this group is the Schiff base lysine of the chromophore binding site of rhodopsin which becomes exposed on photolysis. The low pKa for this active lysine would result in a more stable retinal-opsin linkage, and might be induced by a nearby positively charged group on the protein (either arginine or a second lysine residue). This leads to a model involving intramolecular protonation of the Schiff base nitrogen in the retinal-opsin linkage of rhodopsin, which is consistent with the thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of the system. We further propose that the metarhodopsin I leads to metarhodopsin II step in the bleaching sequence involves reversible hydrolysis of the Schiff base linkage in the chromophore binding site, and that subsequent steps are the result of migration of the chromophore from this site.

8080|t|Structural analysis of O2'-methyl-5-carbamoylmethyluridine, a newly discovered constituent of yeast transfer RNA.
8080|a|A compound tentatively identified as O2-methyl-5-carboxymethyluridine (cm5Um) was recently isolated in this laboratory from bulk yeast transfer RNA (Gray, M. W. (1975), Can, J. Biochem. 53, 735-746). Alkaline hydrolysis of yeast tRNA releases this nucleoside as part of an alkali-stable dinucleotide, cm5Um-Ap, from which sufficient cm5Um was prepared in the present investigation for a detailed examination of its properties. The ultraviolet absorption spectra and chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of cm5Um were consistent with the proposed structure, which was confirmed by characterization of the base and sugar moieties as 5-carboxymethyluracil and 2-O-methylribose, respectively. Snake venom hydrolysis of yeast tRNA releases cm5Um in the form of a carboxyl-blocked 5'-nucleotide, designated pU-2. Identification of the alkali-labile blocking group in pU-2 as an amide was based on quantitative assay for ammonia released upon acid hydrolysis of the corresponding nucleoside, U-2, and by chromatographic comparison of U-2 with the semisynthetic methyl ester and amide derivatives of cm5Um (mcm5Um and ncm5Um, respectively). Quantitative analysis has indicated that ncm5Um may be confined to a single species of yeast tRNA. In view of the unique localization (the "Wobble" position of the anticodon sequence) and coding properties (pairing with A but not with G) of other cm5U derivatives in transfer RNA, the dinucleotide cm5Um-Ap may be derived from the first two positions of the anticodon sequence of a yeast tRNA species recognizing an NUA codon. This predicts that O2-methyl-5-carbamoylmethyluridine will be found in an isoleucine, leucine, or valine isoacceptor.

8090|t|pH dependence of tritium exchange with the C-2 protons of the histidines in bovine trypsin.
8090|a|At pH 8.9 and 37 degrees C the half-times for tritium exchange with the C-2 protons of the histidines of trypsin are 73 days for His-57, and greater than 1000 days for His-40 and His-91. These half-times are much longer than the half-life of exchange for the C-2 proton of free histidine (2.8 days at pD 8.2), and longer than any previously reported half-time of exchange at pH greater than 8. These very low rates of exchange are discussed with reference to the refined structure of trypsin. The tritium exchange of His-57 depends on an apparent pKa of 6.6. This pKa may represent the pKa of the imidazole of His-57 in an inactive conformation of the enzyme.

8092|t|Role of bound calcium ions in thermostable, proteolytic enzymes. Separation of intrinsic and calcium ion contributions to the kinetic thermal stability.
8092|a|The total kinetic thermal stability of a protein molecule, expressed as the total free energy of activation in thermal denaturation reactions, can be separated into an intrinsic contribution of the polypeptide chain and a contribution due to the binding of calcium ions. The theory for this procedure is applied to thermal denaturation data, obtained at the pH of optimum stability, for the serine proteases, thermomycolase and subtilisin types Carlsberg and BPN', and for the zinc metalloendopeptidases, thermolysin and neutral protease A. The results, obtained from Arrhenius plots at high and low free calcium ion concentrations, reveal a considerable variation in the calcium ion contribution to the total kinetic thermal stability of the various enzymes. In the serine protease group, at 70 degrees C, the stability is largest for thermomycolase, mainly due to a relatively high intrinsic contribution. For the metalloendopeptidases the total kinetic thermal stability is largest for thermolysin, the difference between thermolysin and neutral protease A being dominated by bound calcium ion contributions. The intrinsic kinetic thermal stability of the polypeptide chain of thermolysin is considerably smaller than that of any of the serine proteases and is probably of the same order of magnitude as that of neutral protease A. Thus, the well known total kinetic thermal stability of thermolysin is due mainly to a single calcium ion (Voordouw, G., and Roche, R. S. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 4667) that binds with high affinity even at very high temperatures (K congruent to 6 X 10(7) M-1 at 80 degrees C).

8094|t|Evidence for more than one Ca2+ transport mechanism in mitochondria.
8094|a|The active transport and internal binding of the Ca2+ analogue Mn2+ by rat liver mitochondria were monitored with electron paramagnetic resonance. The binding of transported Mn2+ depended strongly on internal pH over the range 7.7-8.9. Gradients of free Mn2+ were compared with K+ gradients measured on valinomycin-treated samples. In the steady state, the electrochemical Mn2+ activity was larger outside than inside the mitochondria. The observed gradients of free Mn2+ and of H+ could not be explained by a single "passive" uniport or antiport mechanism of divalent cation transport. This conclusion was further substantiated by observed changes in steady-state Ca2+ and Mn2+ distributions induced by La3+ and ruthenium red. Ruthenium red reduced total Ca2+ or Mn2+ uptake, and both inhibitors caused release of divalent cation from preloaded mitochondria. A model is proposed in which divalent cations are transported by at least two mechanisms: (1) a passive uniport and (2) and active pump, cation antiport or anion symport. The former is more sensitive to La3+ and ruthenium red. Under energized steady-state conditions, the net flux of Ca2+ or Mn2+ is inward over (1) and outward over (2). The need for more than one transport system inregulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ is discussed.

8095|t|The metal ion catalyzed decomposition of nucleoside diphosphate sugars.
8095|a|The metal ion catalysed decomposition of the nucleotide diphosphate sugars, uridine diphosphate glucose, uriding diphosphate galactose, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine, guanosine diphosphate mannose, and guanosine diphosphate fucose (UDPGlc, UDPGal, UDPGlc-NAc, GDPMan, and GDPFuc, respectively), has been studies as a function of pH. UDPDlc and UDPGal decompose readily to the a,2-cycle phosphate derivative of the sugar and uridine 5'-phosphoric acid (UMP) in the presence of Mn2+. Under all conditions tested, UDPGal decomposes two to three times more rapidly than does UDPGlc. GDPFuc is slowly degraded to free fucose under similar conditions; the other nucleotide diphosphate sugars are stable. The rate of reaction increases with increasing hydroxide ion concentration from pH 6.5 to 7.9 and with metal ion concentration from 10 to 200 mm. Several metal ions are effective catalysts; at pH 7.5 WITH 20 mM UDPGal and 20 mM metal ion, the following apparent first-order rate constants (min-1 x 10(4)) were obtained: Eu3+ 700; Mn2+, 70; Co2+ 27; Zn2+, 22; Ca2+, 3.0; Cu2+, 2.4; and Mg2+, 0. It appears that Mn2+ concentrations that have been used in studies with nucleotide diphosphate sugars at neutral pH can catalyze significant decomposition leading to erroneous interpretation of kinetic and incorporation experiments.

8143|t|Human erythrocyte glutathione reductase. I. Purification and properties.
8143|a|1. Glutathione reductase (NAD(P)H:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase, EC. 1.6.4.2) from human erythrocytes was purified 49 000-fold with an overall yield of 15% and a 280/460 nm absorbance ratio of 6.03. The procedure used was the method of Worthington and Rosemeyer modified by addition of heating and recrystallization. 2. It was concluded from the results of purification, electrofocusing and inhibition studies that glutathione reductase is a single enzyme which used both NADPH and NADH as hydrogen donors. 3. Apoenzyme cross-reacts with the antibody to the holoenzyme but has a slightly reduced affinity to the antibody. Apoenzyme can be removed from the hemolysate by heating and centrifugation without loss of holoenzyme. 4. Indirect immunological assay of the specific activity of the erythrocyte glutathione reductase is possible in the enzyme saturated with FAD.

8163|t|pH and the level of calcium in the blood of fetal and neonatal albino rats.
8163|a|Near-term rat fetuses in utero are acidotic and hypoxic, and have high levels of total serum calcium. In the first hour of postnatal life, pO2 and pH increase and pCO2 and calcium fall. Between 1 and 4 h following birth, respiratory gases vary little, whereas pH continues to rise and calcium further declines. By 4 h, newborns reach normal pH levels but are markedly hypocalcemic. It is suggested that the 'hypercalcemia' of intrauterine life is related to acidosis in utero, and that following birth, the initial fall in serum calcium is associated with the blowing off of CO2 and a concomitant rise in pH. The later decline in circulating calcium is independent of alterations in respiratory gases and relates directly to the final correction of neonatal acidosis.

8231|t|Antihypertensive action of propranolol in man: lack of evidence for a neural depressive effect.
8231|a|The hypothesis that a neural depressive action is related to the antihypertensive effects of beta blockers has been evaluated in 14 essential hypertensive male patients through the circulatory response to noxious stimuli. The pressor reaction to mental arithmetic was primarily mediated by cardiac stimulation (beta receptors activation), that to cold by vasoconstriction (alpha receptors activation). Arithmetic and cold were tested to separate the effects of peripheral beta blackade from possible neural and other influences. After propanolol (320 mg per day for 3 wk): (1) The baseline pressure was reduced; (2) appearance, peak, and disappearance time of the circulatory reaction to either stimulus was not altered; (3) the pressor effect of arithmetic was decreased in an extent proportional to the reduced rise of cardiac output; and (4) pressure during cold reached the pretreatment levels through an augmented increase of vascular resistance. Our findings indicate that propranolol depresses only the circulatory reactions mediated through beta receptors activation and provide no evidence of effects other than beta blockade.

8283|t|Pleural fluid pH in parapneumonic effusions.
8283|a|The pH and carbon dioxide tension were measured in 24 consecutive parapneumonic effusions, along with the leukocyte count, leukocytic differential count, and levels of glucose and protein. Three categories of parapneumonic effusions were characterized: (1) empyemas; (2) benign (nonloculated) effusions; and (3) loculated effusions. A pH greater than 7.30 was present in all ten benign effusions, and spontaneous resolution occurred in each case. All ten empyemas and the four loculated effusions had a pH less than 7.30. All four loculated effusions required drainage with a chest tube for resolution. The pH of the pleural fluid alone separated the empyemas and loculated effusions from benign effusions. The early separation of parapneumonic effusions on the basis of the pleural fluid appears useful. If the pH is greater than 7.30, a benign effusion is present, and spontaneous resolution is likely. If the pH is less than 7.30, loculation of the pleural space may occur regardless of whether the effusion fulfills the criteria for empyema.

8311|t|On the transport of tripeptide antibiotics in bacteria.
8311|a|The two tripeptide antibiotics L-2-amino-4-methylphosphinobutyryl-alanyl-alanyl-alanine (L-phosphinothricyl-alanyl-alanine) and L-(N5-phosphono)methionine-S-sulfoximinyl-alanyl-alanine, both inhibitors of the glutamine synthetase, are transported into the cell of Escherichia coli K 12 via the oligopeptide transport system. The uptake by this system is proved first of all by cross-resistance with tri-L-ornithine using oligopeptide-transport-deficient mutants, and secondly by antagonism tests demonstrating competitive reversal of the action of the antibiotic by several peptides which have been shown to be transported via the oligopeptide transport system, e.g. tri-L-alanine, tetra-L-alanine, tri-L-lysine, tri-L-serine, tri-glycine, glycyl-glycyl-L-alanine and the synthetic tripeptide L-azadenyl-aminohexanoyl-alanyl-alanine. On the other hand, there is no effect on the action of the antibiotic in antagonism tests with compounds which use different transport systems, such as L-alanyl-alanine, L-lysyl-lysine, glutathione and the synthetic amino acid azaadenylaminohexanoic acid, i.e. 2-amino-6-(7-amino-3H-v-triazolo-[4,5-d]-pyrimidin-3-yl)hexanoic acid. Another inhibitor of the glutamine synthetase, L-methionine-S-dioxide (methioninesulfone) could be converted into a tripeptide form by linkage to L-alanyl-alanine analogously to the tripeptide antibiotics described above. Whereas the free L-methionine-S-dioxide seems to be transported via the methionine transport system, the tripeptide form is transported via the oligopeptide transport system. Thus, this glutamine synthetase inhibitor can be taken up by the cell via two different transport mechanisms. Our results indicate that this could provide a synergistic effect. The syntheses of the new tripeptides L-azaadenylaminohexanoyl-alanyl-alanine and L-methionine-S-dioxidyl-alanyl-alanine were performed by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide couplings of the unusual N-protected L-alpha-amino acids azaadenylaminohexanoic acid and L-methionine-S-dioxide to L-alanyl-alanine-tert-butyl ester followed by common deprotection steps. Tri-L-ornithine was synthesized without carboxyl protection via two successive couplings of hydroxybenzotriazol esters of Nalpha-butoxycarbonyl-Ndelta-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-ornithine.

8357|t|Effects of carbenoxolone on gastric mucosal permeability and blood flow in the dog.
8357|a|The effects of topical application of carbenoxolone at neutral and acidic pH were compared in exteriorized, chambered segments of canine gastric corpus. When dissolved in saline at pH 7.5 to 8.0, 0.25% carbenoxolone caused a rapid drop in gastric potential difference of 56 +/- 2 mv and greatly increased permeability to H+ ions. Blood flow, as measured by radioactive microspheres, was not changed by carbenoxolone treatment, but subsequent exposure to isotonic HC1 caused an abrupt rise in flow. Application of 0.25% carbenoxolone suspension in isotonic HC1 caused no change in potential difference, permeability, or blood flow. Neither carbenoxolone preparation had a significant effect on aspirin-induced H+ back-diffusion or injury.

8378|t|Biological effects of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo. I. Selection in the mouse thymus of killer and helper cells.
8378|a|In the present study we have investigated the biological effects on thymus lymphocytes resulting from Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in young adult mice. It has been established that LPS induces the following effects: (a) a dose-dependent reduction of thymus weight contemporaneous with a rise in the anti-LPS antibody response; (b) an increase of killer activity of thymus cells; (c) an enhancement of thymocytes helper activity; (d) a reduction of theta-positive cells in the thymus; (e) a cellular depletion in the thymus cortex. These data, indicating that LPS selects in the thymus a population of cells more efficient in expressing both killer and helper functions, are interpreted as caused by an increased rate of cortisol secretion induced by the LPS treatment.

8387|t|Case report: sterility due to sperm autoagglutination.
8387|a|Autoagglutination in seminal fluid of husbands in three unexplained sterile couples was found in routine semen-analysis. Further exploration showed that sera and seminal fluid of these husbands agglutinate donors' sperm, while their wives' sera did not. Post-coital tests were not significant. After failure of conservative treatment with vitamin C, two couples agreed to AID followed promptly by pregnancies and deliveries. The possible connection between sterility and sperm-auto-agglutination is discussed, stressing the justification for looking at these phenomena more carefully and with more attention.

8388|t|Distribution and removal of the acrosin of bull spermatozoa.
8388|a|The effects of Hyamine 2389, Triton X-100, Nadeoxycholate, acetic acid and hypertonic KCl and MgCl2 as well as freezing and thawing and sonication were studied on the solubilization of acrosin from washed bull spermatozoa, from Hyamine-pretreated spermatozoa (devoid of cell and outer acrosome membrane and of acrosomal material) and from isolated acrosomal caps and vesicles. Concurrent ultrastructural changes were observed. Hyamine, Triton, KCl, and acetic acid effectively solubilized acrosin from whole spermatozoa but MgCl2 had a poor effect. The outer acrosome membrane and acrosomal material extracted by Hyamine contained about 35-40% of the total acrosin activity, and three quarters of it was soluble. The rest of acrosin situated in the innter acrosome membrane or equatorial segment was best extracted by hypertonic KCl and MgCl2, but the detergents were ineffective in this case indicating that acrosin is bound differently to the outer and inner parts of acrosome. The opposite effect of MgCl2 on the acrosin activities extracted from these two parts could even be a suggestion of multiple forms of acrosin. The increase of the total acrosin activity during the Hyamine treatment indicates that acrosin is partly in an inactive form. due either to steric hindrance, inhibitor complex of existence of a proacrosin.

8398|t|Fertility patterns in female mice following treatment with arginine vastocin or melatonin.
8398|a|Daily injections of either 2 mug arginine vasotocin (AVT) or 100 mug melatonin significantly prolonged the estrous cycles of mature female mice. If administered daily throughout pregnancy, none of the AVT-treated mice delivered viable pups.

8410|t|[Ultrastructural localization of acid phosphatase and thiamine pyrophosphatase activities and of phosphotungstic staining at low pH in the placental labyrinth of the cat].
8410|a|The localizations of acid phosphatase (ACPase) and thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPPase) activities were studied in the placental labyrinth of the cat during the last days of gestation. ACPase activities were observed essentially in the syncytiotrophoblast and in the "interstitial inert substance" (S.I.I.) that separates maternal from foetal tissues. Reaction product was localized in lysosomes, multivesicular bodies, and in the network of smooth-membraned tubules which open on the cell surface of the syncytiotrophoblast facing the S.I.I. The S.I.I. exhibit a strong activity, probably of syncytiotrophoblastic origin. TPPase activities were found in the syncytiotrophoblast, rarely in the Golgi apparatus but always in the lumen of the network of smooth-membrande tubules. The S.I.I. shows a moderate activity. These TPPase positive tubules being frequently observed very close to the Golgi cisternae, it is proposed that they arise from the Golgi complex and convey phosphatases to the S.I.I. After phosphotungstic acid staining at low pH, luminal surface coat of maternal endothelium is always strongly and continuously visualized, while the plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast facing the S.I.I. is never stained. Staining is intense in the lumen of tubules, and continuous with the stain of the S.I.I. ACPase activity of the S.I.I. could be implicated in enzymatic degradation of maternal molecules during their transfer from maternal to foetal blood. The S.I.I. may correspond to the immunological buffer zone at the interface between maternal and foetal tissues.

8412|t|Quantitative cytochemical measurement of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity.
8412|a|A system has been developed for the quantitative measurment of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in tissue sections. An obstacle to the histochemical study of this enzyme has been the fact that the substrate, gylceraldehyde 3-phosphate, is very unstable. In the present system a stable compound, fructose 1, 6-diphosphate, is used as the primary substrate and the demonsatration of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity depends on the conversion of this compound into the specific substrate by the aldolase present in the tissue. The characteristics of the dehydrogenase activity resulting from the addition of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate, resemble closely the known properties of purified glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Use of polyvinyl alcohol in the reaction medium prevents release of enzymes from the sections, as occurs in aqueous media. Although in this study intrinsic aldolase activity was found to be adequate for the rapid conversion of fructose 1, 6-diphosphate into the specific substrate for the dehydrogenase, the use of exogenous aldolase may be of particular advantage in assessing the intergrity of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.

8419|t|Propagated spikes and secretion in a coelenterate glandular epithelium
8419|a|The rete mirabile of Hippopodius (Cl. Hydrozoa, O. Siphonophora) is a sheet of giant endoderm cells penetrated by branches of the ventral radial canal. The cells appear to be highly polyploid. The rough ER is very richly developed and expanded ER cisternae containing amorphous material (presumably synthesized protein) are observed near the outer cell surface. The cells are electrically coupled, and are connected by gap junctions. The rete is electrically excitable and cell to cell conduction of action potentials at 10 cm/s is observed. The action potentials are all-or-none, positive-going events, showing amplitudes of about 70 mV and arising from a 44 mV resting potential. Slowly developing and decaying secondary depolarizations, capable of summing to the 20 mV level, are also observed. After passage of a train of impulses, the rete cells swell and secretion drops appear at the surface, these changes becoming apparent within a few seconds. In 15 mM Mn2+ the response fails to occur, and secondary depolarizations ("secretion potentials") are not seen. Spike propagation is not affected. In Na+-free solutions the spikes are reduced and propagation eventually fails. It is suggested that the spikes are sodium-dependent events which trigger a calcium-dependent secretory process. The composition and biological activity of the secretion are uncertain, but indirect evidence suggests a possible defensive or repellant role for the response.

8441|t|Purification and properties of the extracellular dextransucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299.
8441|a|Dextransucrase [EC 2.4.1.5] activity from cell-free culture supernatant of Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-1299 was purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, adsorption on hydroxyapatite, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The extracellular enzyme was separated into two principal forms, enzymes I and N, and the latter was shown to be an aggregated form of the protomer, enzyme I. Enzymes I and N were both electrophoretically homogeneous and their relative activities reached 820 and 647 times that of the culture supernatant, respectively. On sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, enzyme N dissociated into the protomer enzyme I, with a molecular weight of 48,000. Enzyme I was gradually converted into enzyme N upon aging, and this conversion was stimulated in the presence of NaCl. The optimum pH and temperature of enzyme I activity were pH 6.0 and 40 degrees, respectively, while those of enzyme N were pH 5.5 and 35 degrees. The Km values of enzymes I and N were 13.9 and 13.1 mM, respectively. Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ stimulated the activity of enzyme N, and EDTA showed a potent inhibitory effect on this enzyme. Moreover, the activity of enzyme N was more effectively stimulated by exogenous dextrans as compared with enzyme I.

8443|t|Purification, crystallization, and some properties of creatine amidinohydrolase from Pseudomonas putida.
8443|a|A method was developed for purification and crystallization of creatinase [creatine amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.3] from Pseudomonas putida var. naraensis C-83. The purified preparation appeared homogeneous on disc electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation and had a molecular weight of 94,000. It was most active at pH 8 and stable between pH 6 and 8 for 24 hr at 37 degrees. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the native enzyme was made up of two subunit monomers, the molecular weights of which were estimated to be 47,000. Inhibition experiments suggested that a sulfhydryl group is located in or near the active site of the enzyme.

8452|t|The allosteric regulation of hexokinase C from amphibian liver.
8452|a|A type C hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose-6-phosphotransferase EC 2.7.1.1) was partially purified from the liver of the frog Calyptocephalella caudiverbera. The enzyme is inhibited by glucose levels in the range of normal blood sugar concentrations. The extent of the inhibition by glucose depends on the concentration of ATP, being most marked between 1 and 5 mM ATP. Fructose, although a substrate, was not inhibitory of its own phosphorylation. The inhibitory effect of high glucose levels exhibited a strong, reversible pH dependence being most marked at pH 6.5. At pH 7.5 the inhibition by high glucose levels was a function of the enzyme concentration, the effect being stronger at high enzyme concentrations, whereas no inhibition was observed when assaying very diluted preparations. At all enzyme concentrations studied, high levels of glucose caused no inhibition at pH 8.5, whereas at pH 6.5 strong inhibition was always observed. Short times of photooxidation of hexokinase C as well as incubation with low concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzoate resulted in the loss of the inhibition by excess of glucose. Glucose-6-phosphate was found to be a strong inhibitor of hexokinase C but only at high glucose levels. The inhibitory effect of glucose-6-P follows sigmoidal kinetics at low (about 0.02 mM) glucose concentrations, the Hill coefficient being 2.3. The kinetics of the inhibition became hyperbolic at high (greater than 0.2 mM) glucose levels. These results suggest that the inhibition of hexokinase C by excess glucose is due to the interaction of glucose with a second, aldose-specific, regulatory site on the enzyme. The modification of the inhibitory effect by ATP, glucose-6-P, enzyme concentration, and pH, all of them at physiological levels, indicates a major role for hexokinase C in the regulation of glucose utilization by the liver.

8455|t|Titration behavior of individual tyrosine residues of myoglobins from sperm whale, horse, and red kangaroo.
8455|a|The titration behavior of individual tyrosine residues of myoglobins has been studied by observing the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of Czeta and Cgamma of these residues in natural abundance of 13C Fourier transform NMR spectra (at 15.18 MHz, in 20-mm sample tubes, at 37 degrees) of cyanoferrimyoglobins from sperm whale, horse, and red kangaroo. A comparison of the pH dependence of the spectra of the three proteins yielded specific assignments for the resonance of Tyr-151 (sperm whale) and Tyr-103 (sperm whale and horse). Selective proton decoupling yielded specific assignments for Czeta of Tyr-146 of the cyanoferrimyoglobins from horse and kangaroo, but not the corresponding assignment for sperm whale. The pH dependence of the chemical shifts indicated that only Tyr-151 and Tyr-103 are titratable tyrosine residues. Even at pH 12, Tyr-146 did not begin to titrate. The titration behavior of C zeta and Cgamma of Tyr-151 of sperm whale cyanoferrimyoglobin yielded a single pK value of 10.6. The pH dependence of the chemical shift of each of the resonances of Tyr-103 of the cyanoferrimyoglobins from horse and sperm whale could not be fitted with the use of a single pK value, but was consistent with two pK values (about 9.8 and 11.6). Furthermore, the resonances of Czeta and Cgamma of Tyr-103 broadened at high pH. The titration behavior of the tyrosines of sperm whale carbon monoxide myoglobin and horse ferrimyoglobin was also examined. A comparison of all the experimental results indicated that Tyr-151 is exposed to solvent, Tyr-146 is not exposed, and Tyr-103 exhibits intermediate behavior. These results for myoglobins in solution are consistent with expectations based on the crystal structure.

8458|t|Reactivity of the phosphopyridoxal groups of cystathionase.
8458|a|Aminooxyacetate and alpha-amino-gamma-aminooxybutyrate (canaline) react specifically with the P-pyridoxal groups of cystathionase to produce characteristic changes in the absorption and fluorescence properties of the bound cofactor. The increase in fluorescence at 450 nm was used to monitor the reaction. Aminooxyacetate attacks the Schiff base linkage of the enzyme several times faster (k1 = 3700 M-1 min-1 and k2 = 1000 M-1 min-1) than it attacks the aldehydic carbon of free P-pyridoxal (k = 290 M-1 min-1). Similar results were obtained with canaline. The kinetic studies indicate that a Schiff base linkage in the enzyme cystathionase should offer direct kinetic advantage during the reaction between the substrate and the cofactor. It is also shown that the inhibitor L-alpha-gamma-aminobutyrate reacts with bound P-pyridoxal to form free P-pyridoxamine. The rate of formation of P-pyridoxamine parallels the rate of enzyme inactivation.

8469|t|Central nervous system pH in uremia and the effects of hemodialysis.
8469|a|Rapid hemodialysis of uremic animals may induce a syndrome characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, grand mal seizures, and electroencephalographic abnormalities. There is a fall in pH and bicarbonate concentration in CSF, and brain osmolality exceeds that of plasma, resulting in a net movement of water into the brain. This syndrome has been called experimental dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. The fall in pH of CSF may be secondary to a fall of intracellular pH (pHi) in brain. Since changes in pHi can alter intracellular osmolality in other tissues, it was decided to investigate brain pHi in uremia, and the effects of hemodialysis. Brain pHi was measured by evaluating the distribution of 14C-labeled dimethadione in brain relative to CSF, while extracellular space was calculated as the 35504=/4 space relative to CSF. In animals with acute renal failure, brain (cerebral cortex) pHi was 7.06+/-0.02 (+/-SE) while that in CSF was 7.31+/-0.02, both values not different from normal. After rapid hemodialysis (100 min) of uremic animals, plasma creatinine fell from 11.8 to 5.9 mg/dl. Brain pHi was 6.89+/-0.02 and CSF pH and 7.19+/-0.02, both values significantly lower than in uremic animals (P less than 0.01), and there was a 12% increase in brain water content. After slow hemodialysis (210 min), brain pHi (7.01+/-0.02) and pH in CSF (7.27+/-0.02) were both significantly greater than values observed after rapid hemodialysis (P less than 0.01), and brain water content was normal. None of the above maneuvers had any effect on pHi of skeletal muscle or subcortical white matter. The data show that rapid hemodialysis of uremic dogs is accompanied by a significant fall in pH of CSF and pHi in cerebral cortex. Accompanying the fall in brain pHi is cerebral edema.

8575|t|Inflammatory reaction and airway damage in cystic fibrosis.
8575|a|In cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory reaction in the airways, accompanied by destruction and shedding of airway epithelium. Leukocytes migrate into the airways and some disintegrate, liberating deoxyribonucleoprotein that is incorporated into the gel structure of the bronchial mucus. We compared the status of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, by examining the sputum raised from the lower airways. Measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal subjects. The results indicate that migration of leukocytes into the airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the normal subjects; they were significant in the patients with chronic bronchitis, higher in those with bronchiectasis, and still higher in those with cystic fibrosis. The large increases found in the total content of DNA and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was solubilized with mercaptoethanol. Despite the large increases in the total content of DNA and solids, the contents of mucus gel components and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated leukocytes actually present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with chronic bronchitis or brochiectasis.

8581|t|[The determination of cystine aminopoptidase (oxytocinase) with a ENI fast analyzer (author's transl)].
8581|a|A procedure for the determination of cystine aminopeptidase activity was adapted to a fast analyzer. The various reaction parameters were checked. The precision of the method was about 5%. Cystine aminopeptidase activity was stable for long storage periods at +4 degrees C and -20 degrees C. The normal range for the terminal weeks of pregnancy was determined on samples from female patients with normal pregnancies.

8647|t|Bifidobacteria in the intestinal tract of infants: an in-vitro study.
8647|a|In-vitro studies showed that a number of factors are likely to influence the production and maintenance of a bifidobacillary flora and low pH in the faeces of newborn infants. Considerable importance is attached to the nature of the end products of bacterial metabolism in the large intestine. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that acetic acid and other metabolites of intraluminal bacterial growth suppress the growth of gram-negative organisms, but are without effect upon that of bifidobacteria. This mechanism in turn is controlled by the nature of the feed; important factors in breast milk include high lactose, low protein and low phosphate content.

8663|t|[Interrelations between blood pressure, blood volume, plasma renin and urinary catecholamines during beta-blockade in essential hypertension (author's transl)].
8663|a|Studies in 55 patients with benign essential hypertension showed that the beta-blockers bufuralol (22 patients) and propranolol (33 patients) at a dose ratio of 1:4, possess comparable antihypertensive efficacy despite different properties regarding intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Beta-blocker-monotherapy normalized blood pressure ( less than 140/90 mm Hg) in one fourth of the patients. Body weight and plasma and blood volumes remained unchanged during beta-blockade of four to six weeks duration, the mean plasma potassium was slightly increased. The inhibition of plasma renin activity (PRA) was more pronounced with propranolol (-69%) than with bufuralol (-47%). Wirth both beta-blockers decreases in blood pressure correlated inversely with pre-treatment PRA (p less than 0.05). Propranolol-induced changes in blood pressure correlated also with associated changes in PRA (p less than 0.005); in contrast, no such relationship was observed with bufuralol. The blood pressure effects of bufuralol, however, correlated significantly with changes in urinary noradrenaline excretion (r=0.41; p less than 0.05). Patient sub-groups with low, normal or high pre-treatment PRA in the average showed a comparable pattern of pre-treatment noradrenaline excretion and patients with normal renin levels exreted more adrenaline than those with low renin levels (p less than 0.001). These data are consistent with the concept that in untreated essential hypertension PRA may be an index of adrenergic activiity, the latter representing an important determinant of blood pressure response to beta-blockade. The blood pressure lowering effects of bufuralol in benign essential hypertension seem to be independent of renin and may be related, at least partly, to diminished free peripheral noradrenaline levels.

8714|a|According to recommended international standards edible fungi are blanched before salting and freezing. A study was conducted on the solution losses of Lactarius rufus due to blanching. Weight losses, changes of dry matter, raw fat, total nitrogen, amino nitrogen and ash contents as well as the pH value were determined when various methods of blanching were used. 3 min blanching at 95-100 degrees C was able to inactivate catalase and peroxydase while 6 min blanching was needed for inactivating polyphenoloxydase totally. After blanching there were 1/10 - 1/100 of spores left. During the 3 min blanching in water five times the quantity of mushrooms the losses of dry matter were about 10%; when doubling the quantity of blanching water the losses increased to 2-3 fold. The doubling of blanching time had no significant influence on the losses. The soluble dry matter content of blanched mushrooms was less than 50% of that of the fresh. Total nitrogen of fresh mushrooms was equal to that of the blanched but the amino nitrogen decreased to one tenth by blanching. The mineral element content of blanched mushrooms was about the half of that of the fresh. Blanching caused a slight decrease in the pH value. The necessity of the blanching of all edible fungi before freezing was discussed.

8716|t|[Complex gels of proteins and acid polysaccharides].
8716|a|The authors studied the thermomechanical properties of complex gels of gelatin and sodium alginate which had been produced on the basis of their insoluble (type I) and soluble (type II) complexes. Compared to gelatin gels of the same concentration, the complex gels I have higher melting points. The latter depend on the pH value at which the insoluble complexes of gelatin and sodium alginate were separated. Up to temperatures from 70 degrees--80 degrees C., no melting of the complex gels II was observed. The aging time and the composition of the soluble complexes of gelatin and sodium alginate exert no marked effects on the properties of the complex gels II. The soluble complexes of gelatin and sodium alginate can form gels in 7 M urea solutions.

8723|t|[Characterization and spinning of alkaline solutions of wheat protein and casein].
8723|a|The viscosity behaviour of alkaline solutions of mixtures from different wheat glutens with casein in dependence on the concentration of the whole protein, wheat protein, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride and on the temperature, time and the effect of treatment of wet wheat gluten with sodium chloride or sodium hydroxide on the properties of the spun wheat protein/casein fibers are described. Based on this model experiments the rheological behaviour of alkaline solutions of wheat protein/casein (I:2) and proceed from the parameters of the spinning process the properties of the corresponding spun fibers are represented.

8750|t|The rational use of anxiolytics.
8750|a|The prescribing of anxiolytics is often a hit-and-miss process. Current knowledge is examined to encourage a more rational use of such drugs. Because the common symptoms occur in a great array of illnesses, diagnosis is of first importance. For the transient situational disturbance drugs may be unnecessary or may be used merely for a day or two. If the anxiety state persists for a month or so the illness might be termed an anxiety neurosis and if there is no accompanying depression, a short course of benzodiazepine may be of value. With depression present to more than a mild degree as part of the neurosis the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin usually achieves better results than a benzodiazepine. Imipramine can be helpful for the phobic anxiety syndrome and monoamine-oxidase inhibitors can be of separate utility. If the anxiety and depression occur in the context of alcoholism, thioridazine and amitriptyline have certain advantages. There is very little place for phenothiazines or other antipsychotic agents in low doses in the therapy of anxiety except for thioridazine in the above indication.

8779|t|Binding of [3H]dihydroazapetine to alpha-adrenoreceptor-related proteins from rat vas deferens.
8779|a|The potent alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, azapetine, has been catalytically reduced with tritium gas to form [3H]dihydroazapetine. [3H]Dihydroazapetine retains significant ability to block alpha-adrenoreceptors and has been used as a ligand to study the receptor in a subcellular fraction containing membrane fragments from rat vas deferens. Specific binding of [3H]dihydroazapetine rapidly reaches equilibrium and is also reversible and saturable with a dissociation constant similar to that determined pharmacologically. The binding capacity is approximately 40 pmol/mg of protein. All alpha-adrenergic blockers tested were able to inhibit specific binding. High concentrations of alprenolol, atropine, or chlorpheniramine had no effect. In addition, all alpha-adrenergic agonists of the imidazoline class inhibit binding in low concentrations, whereas soterenol or carbamylcholine did not. There is good correlation (r=0.84) between blockade or stimulation of the receptor in intact tissues and inhibition of binding of [3H]dihydroazapetine to the subcellular fraction. These findings suggest that the fraction contains alpha-adrenoreceptor-related proteins. Alpha-adrenergic agonists structurally related to norepinephrine caused a stereoselective increase in binding in favor of the (-)-isomer, possibly reflecting an allosteric interaction at a different binding site on the receptor protein. The possibility of two different modes of binding for structurally dissimilar agonists is suggested.

8799|t|The rectal complex in the larvae of lepidoptera.
8799|a|In the so-called "cryptonephric" condition of the excretory system in insects the distal ends of the Malpighian tubules are closely applied to the rectum and enclosed with it in a special chamber, the perinephric space, separated from the rest of the body cavity by the perinephric membrane. The term "rectal complex" refers to this association of tubules and rectum, which is found in the larvae (but not in the adults) of most Lepidoptera. In the mealworm (Coleoptera) the rectal complex has notable ability to remove water from the faeces, but this ability is not conspicuously developed in the larvae of the two species of Lepidoptera here studied: Pieris brassicae and Manduca sexta. On the other hand these larvae have notable ability to maintain salt balance under heavy dietary loading, and in this the rectal complex plays an important part. A study of salt balance in more detail has shown that more sodium can be eliminated in the faeces than enters the rectal complex from the intestine. Consideration of other possible routes of entry points strongly to the Malpighian tubules. Superimposed upon a new flow of tubule fluid out of the rectal complex there is a tidal flow, brought about by the rectal musculature and amplified by dilatations of the cryptonephric tubules, which could bring in fluid from the free tubules and afford opportunity for the uptake of salts. Evidence is presented in support of this view. This tidal flow of tubule fluid and uptake of salts could be the basis of the build-up of high osmolarity in the perinephric fluid and could contribute to the removal of water from the faeces. It could also be the basic mechanism in the mealworm, the leptophragmal mechanism being superimposed upon it.

8811|t|Drug-induced parkinsonism in the rat- a model for biochemical investigation of the parkinson-syndrome. III. The incorporation of D-glucose-14C(U) in amino acids of brain and liver from rats pretreated with reserpine or with phenothiazines.
8811|a|Following treatment with reserpine or alternatively with a combination of phenothiazines (Randolektil, Majeptil) a drug-induced parkinsonoid reaction was provoked in rats. Twenty min before decapitation, 18 muCi d-glucose-14C(U) was administered intravenously. Concentration and radioactivities of glutamic acid (glu), glutamine (gln), serine (ser), and glycine (gly) were assayed in some regions of brain and in liver. Separation was performed by a combination of paper electrophoresis and chromatography or by an automatic amino acid analyzer. 1 After reserpine, the concentrations of serine and glycine were increased ten-fold while their specific activities decreased by the same factor. The interconversion serine-glycine was not affected. The concentration of glutamic acid was reduced while its specific activity remained constant. 2. After phenothiazines, the concentrations of serine and glycine in brain were also increased but their specific activities were decreased to a different degree. This indicates an additional effect on the serine-synthesis from glucose. The interconversion serine-glycine was also altered. The concentration of glutamic acid was decreased but specific activity was constant except in the thalamus region tested. 3. The influence of both treatments on amino acid turnover in liver differed from the observed impairment of brain metabolism. 4. Possible correlations between the changes in amino acid metabolism, catecholamines, and the neurologic parkinsonian symptoms are discussed.

8835|t|A long-term study of benorylate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
8835|a|The analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy and adverse effects of benorylate were studied over a period of 6 months in 33 patients suffering from definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis. The average dose used was 6 g daily and examinations were made before treatment and at regular intervals during treatment to assess the clinical status of the patient, tolerance to the drug and any effect on blood, liver or renal function. Benorylate had a satisfactory effect in 28 patients. Additional treatment was requried in 3 cases and treatment discontinued in 2 cases. Distinct improvement of grip strength, morning stiffness and E.S.R. in 25 cases indicates the anti-inflammatory efficacy of benorylate. There were no signs of toxicity to bone marrow, liver or kidney. Severe side effects such as stomch ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and severe allergic complications were not observed. Side effects such as constipation and tinnitus that occurred at the beginning of treatment were mainly of a a passing nature and disappeared without a need to change therapy. Benorylate is suitable for the treatment of recent rheumatoid arthritis of a low to moderate activity as well as for long-term treatment.

8858|t|Higher activity of oxidative drug demethylation in the liver microsomes from dystrophic mouse.
8858|a|The activities of NADPH-dependent oxidative demethylation of aminopyrine and other methyl compounds in the liver microsomes from dystrophic mice were found to be about 30% higher than those of the normal mice. Consumption of reduced pyridine nucleotides during the demethylation reactions was also significantly larger in the dystrophic mouse system than in the normal mouse system. The synergistic effect of further addition of NADH on the oxidative demethylation in the reaction system with NADPH, however, was not significant in either the normal or the dystrophic mouse system. The activities of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and lipid peroxidation were also higher by about 30% in the dystrophic mouse than in the normal mouse, but the contents of cytochrome P-450 and phospholipids in the liver microsomes from normal and dystrophic mice were not appreciably different. The results suggest the possibility that the progressive muscular dystrophy may involve abnormal features in not only muscle but also liver and other tissues.

8864|t|[Intermediate metabolism and respiratory function in peritonitis].
8864|a|During observations of 26 patients and in acute and chronic experiments on 31 dogs under conditions of peritonitis the author studied neurohumoral relations and the effect of hydrocortisone on the respiratory function. A conclusion is made on the vital importance of the consistent associated corrective neurohumoral therapy with cholinomimetics and corticosteroids in peritonitis.

8973|t|Nutrition of Glossina morsitans: metabolism of U-14C threonine during pregnancy.
8973|a|Following injection of U-14C threonine into the haemolymph of adult female Glossina morsitans during late pregnancy, radioactivity was detected in the postparturient female and in its offspring, in threonine, lipids, and a range of non-essential amino acids. The level of radioactivity recovered from the larva was higher than that remaining in the injected adult, and the radioactivity recovered was considerably higher in the amino acid than in the lipid fraction. Administration of labelled threonine into maternal haemolymph on each of the first 8 days of the 9-10 day long pregnancy cycle was followed 24 h later by measurement of radioactivity in the developing oöcyte and in the intra-uterine progeny. The patterns of nutrient uptake are discussed in relation to vitellogenesis in the oöcyte and to growth of the larva. Analysis of the expired carbon dioxide and excreta was carried out 24 h after maternal injection of labelled threonine on the first or eighth day of pregnancy. Carbon dioxide and excreta from females in early pregnancy showed significantly higher radioactivity than those from females in late pregnancy. In both cases, radioactivity in the amino acid fraction from the excreta was extremely small and about 95% of the total activity was in uric acid. These results are discussed in terms of the utilization of threonine in relation to the metabolic demands for various nutriments by the pregnant female.

8993|t|Interorgan transport of amino acids in hemorrhagic shock.
8993|a|Arterial concentrations and net organ metabolism of amino acids (AA), O2, CO2, H+, and glucose (Glc) were measured in two dogs before and during hemorrhage and after blood replacement. Shock caused increased splanchnic and decreased peripheral blood flow and O2 consumption. Po2 decreased more in hepatic venous than in mixed venous blood. pH fell in hemorrhage and increased with retransfusion. Increased liver output and arterial concentration of Glc were observed during hemorrhage. Differences between animals correlated with nutritional status. Blood concentrations of most AA showed little change during hemorrhage but increased after retransfusion. In contrast, arginine concentrations declined sharply. Peripheral output and hepatic uptake of most AA occurred during the control period. During shock, peripheral output and hepatic uptake of total AA and most individual AA declined progressively; after retransfusion peripheral uptake and hepatic output of many AA occurred. By contrast, peripheral output and hepatic uptake increased for alanine, glutamine, serine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. After retransfusion net transport of some compounds occurred from periphery to liver; others, from liver to periphery. During shock, hepatic protein catabolism increased. and this catabolism, accompanied by decreased hepatic uptake (increased hepatic output), seemed the main cause of increased blood AA concentrations. Protein catabolism in peripheral tissue was not a cause of increased blood concentrations. Pathological changes in pH, Po2, and blood flow, occurred early in hemorrhage. In contrast, changes in AA movements and concentrations were within normal limits until late in shock.

9024|t|Monitoring the administration of methotrexate in antimetabolite therapy.
9024|a|An enzymatic method for the measurement of methotrexate (MTX) in serum is presented in which the inhibition of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase by MTX is measured. Reduction of the substrate dihydrofolate by the enzyme and cofactor NADPH is lessened in direct proportion to the amount of MTX present. Measurements can be made in the "therapeutic range" of MTX which corresponds to the 10(-7) to 10(-8) M concentration of MTX in serum.

9025|t|Characterization and tissue distribution of N-acetyl hexosaminidase C: suggestive evidence for a separate hexosaminidase locus.
9025|a|1. An electrophoretic system in which N-acetyl hexosaminidase C (HEX(C)) MIGRATES LESS ANODALLY THAN N-acetyl hexosaminidase A (HEX(A)) is described. 2. HEX(C) is shown to differ from HEX(A) and HEX(B) in substrate specificity, molecular size and affinity for Concanavalin-A. 3. HEX(C) is present in a wide range of adult and foetal tissues and in tissues from patients with Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff's diseases. It is particularly prominent in brain, testis, thymus and lymphoblastoid cell extracts and in several foetal tissues. 4. It is suggested that HEX(C) is coded at a separate gene locus from HEX(A) and HEX(B).

9037|t|Regional variation in the distribution of alpha-adrenoreceptors in the vas deferens of the rat.
9037|a|Experiments were performed with preparations obtained by medial transection of the rat vas deferens. Eight sympathomimetic drugs: noradrenaline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline, phenylephrine, dopamine, tyramine, amphetamine, cocaine and isoprenaline, were applied to preparations which were field-stimulated at 10 sec intervals. On the testicular half of the tissue all except isoprenaline enhanced twitches and/or caused contractions. These effects were blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists. On the urethral preparation all except phenylephrine, which often enhanced twitches, inhibited responses to field stimulation. These effects were not blocked by alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists or by propranolol, though the latter blocked inhibitory effects of isoprenaline on both segments. Inhibitory responses to tyramine persisted in urethral segments treated with cocaine and in urethral segments taken from reserpine-treated rats, and thus tyramine may have some direct action. No regional variation was observed in response to acetylcholine or carbachol. High potassium concentrations were equally effective in contracting both segments, but the time courses of contractions differed. These experiments confirm a density gradient of excitatory alpha-adrenoreceptors along the length of the rat vas deferens.

9051|t|[Structure of bromine containing metabolites of carbromal (author's transl)].
9051|a|Isolation of three bromine containing metabolites from human urine is described and their chemical structure is proved by comparison of their physical properties with those of synthetically prepared substances. 2-Bromo-2-ethyl-butyramide, a pharmacologically active product, is showed to be the most important bromine containing metabolite by volume. In 3-position hydroxylated metabolites of carbromal, 3-hydroxy-carbromal and 2-Bromo-2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-butyramide have same physical properties as the synthesized DL-threo--diastereomeres.

9066|t|Iron-dependent binding of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulphonate by both lactoferrin and transferrin.
9066|a|Fluorescence of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulphonate is enhanced by both lactoferrin and transferrin. The enhancement is relatively low between pH 4 and 8, and high at below pH 4. At physiological pH the fluorescence enhancement is higher with the iron-deprived than with the iron-saturated proteins. Binding of iron by lactoferrin is associated with lowering affinity for the dye.

9100|t|Studies on Vaccinium myrtillus anthocyanosides. I. Vasoprotective and antiinflammatory activity.
9100|a|A Vaccinium myrtillus anthocyanosides preparation (equivalent to 25% of anthocyanidins) demonstrated significant vasoprotective and antioedema properties in exerimental animals. In rabbits, the skin capillary permeability increase, due to chloroform, was reduced both after i.p. (25--100 mg/kg) and oral administration (200--400 mg/kg) of anthocyanosides. Their activity was more lasting in comparison to rutin or mepyramine and this did not seem to be due to a specific antagonism towards inflammatory process mediators such as histamine or bradykinin. Experiments carried out in rats demonstrated that Vacinium myrtillus anthocyanosides were effective both in skin capillary permeability test as well as on vascular resistance of rats fed a P factor deficient diet. In the former test effective doses were in the range of 25--100 mg/kg (by oral route). In both the animal species investigated, anthocyanosides were two-fold more active when compared to the flavonoid rutin. Vaccinium myrtillus anthocyanosides by oral route inhibited carrageein paw oedema in rats showing a dose-response relationship. An antioedema activity was detected also after i.v. or topical application.

9125|t|Oral premedication with oxypertine.
9125|a|The preoperative effects of oral oxypertine have been compared with those of papaveretum and atropine in 185 patients in a double-blind between-patient study. Oxypertine 20 mg given orally as a nocturnal sedative and again on the morning of operation produced relief of anxiety comparable to that of papaveretum 10 mg and atropine 0.6 mg. It is concluded that oxypertine may be of value in medication before anaesthesia.

9129|t|Interaction of 1,N6-ethenoadenine derivatives of triphosphopyridine and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotides with dihydrofolate reductase from amethopterin-resistant L1210 cells.
9129|a|The 1,N6-ethenoadenine derivatives of triphosphopyridine and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotides (TPN and TPNH) epsilon-TPN and epsilon-TPNH) have been synthesized and used as fluorescent probes to examine the pyridine nucleotide binding site of L1210 dihydrofolate reductase. Epsilon-TPNH (Km = 16.7 muM) was able to replace TPNH (Km = 3.8 muM) in the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of dihyrdofolate, and both epsilon-TPN and epsilon-TPNH formed binary complexes with the enzyme that were stable to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fluorescence of epsilon-TPN was enhanced and the emission maximum shifted from 415 to 405 nm when the nucleotide was bound to the enzyme. The ethenoadenine moiety in epsilon-TPNH behaved similarily, but the fluorescence changes were complicated by concurrent effects of binding upon the dihydronicotinamide fluorophore. Fluorescence enhancement titrations yielded values of 1.8 and 0.59 muM, respectively, for the dissociation constants of the enzyme-epsilon-TPN and enzyme-epsilon-TPNH complexes. Titration experiments based upon quenching of enzyme fluorescence gave similar values, viz., 2.1 and 0.53 muM for the dissociation constants of these complexes. Fluorimetric titration of the enzyme-TPNH complex with epsilon-TPN (or of the enzyme-TPN complex with epsilon-TPNH) failed to reveal the presence of a second pyridine nucleotide binding site. The fluorescence enhancement of enzyme-bound epsilon-TPN or dihydrofolate was quenched when amethopterin or epsilon-TPN, respectively, was added to form a ternary complex. These results provide information concerning the nature of the pyridine nucleotide binding site and its spatial relationship to the dihydrofolate/amethopterin binding site.

9158|t|Biochemical studies of the excitable membrane of Paramecium aurelia. I. 45Ca2+ fluxes across resting and excited membrane.
9158|a|The characteristics of Ca2+ transport across the excitable membrane of Paramecium aurelia were studied by measuring 45Ca2+ influx and efflux. The intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ in resting P. aurelia was at least ten times less than the extracellular concentration. Ca2+ influx was easily measurable at 0 degrees C, but not at 23 degrees C. The influx of 45Ca2+ was stimulated by the same conditions which cause membrane depolarization and ciliary reversal. Addition of Na+ and K+ (which stimulate ciliary reversal) resulted in a 10-fold increase in the rate of Ca2+ influx. An externally applied, pulsed, electric field (1-2 mA/cm2 of electrode surface), caused the rate of Ca2+ influx to increase 3-5 times, with the extent of stimulation dependent on the current density and the pulse width. Ca2+ influx had the characteristics of a passive transport system and was associated with the chemically or electrically triggered Ca2+ "gating" mechanism, which has been studied electrophysiologically. In contrast, Ca2+ efflux appeared to be catalyzed by an active transport system. With cells previously loaded at 0 degrees C with 45Ca2+, Ca2+ efflux was rapid at 23 degrees C, but did not occur at 0 degrees C. This active Ca2+ efflux mechanism is probably responsible for maintaining the low internal Ca2+ levels in unstimulated cells.

9165|t|Dynamics of the aromatic amino acid residues in the globular conformation of the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). I. 1H NMR studies.
9165|a|The basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was investigated by high resolution 1H NMR techniques at 360 MHz. Observation of the amide proton resonances of the polypeptide backbone showed that the globular conformation of BPTI determined by X-ray studies in single crystals is maintained in aqueous solution over the temperature range from 4 degrees to 87 degrees. NMR studies over this temperature range of the aromatic amino acid residues of BPTI. i.e. 4 tyrosines and 4 phenylalanines, led to complete assignments of all the aromatic spin systems in the protein. From this, information was obtained on the rotational motions about the C beta--Cv bond axis of the aromatic rings in the globular form of PBTI. At 25 degrees, two tyrosine rings and one phenylalanine ring are rotating rapidly on the NMR time scale. For the other rings the transitions from slow to rapid rotational motions were investigated at variable temperatures and energy barriers for these intramolecular rate processes determined. The studies of the tyrosine resonances had been described in detail in a previous publication. The present paper describes the identification of the phenylalanine resonances and comments on some technical aspects which might be of quite general interest for the analysis of highly resolved 1H NMR spectra of proteins. Data for the tyrosines and the phenylalanines are compiled in three tables, i.e. the pK alpha-values for the tyrosines, the NMR parameters for all eight aromatics, and the parameters delta G not equal to, and, where available, delta H not equal to and delta S not equal to for the rotational motions of the rings.

9192|t|Stable L-forms of Clostridium perfringens and their growth on glass surfaces.
9192|a|L-forms of Clostridium perfringens were induced in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% sucrose and 2 units of penicillin. After a few hours of growth, spheroplasts, granules, and elongated bacilli were apparent. At 24-h intervals, serial subcultures were made in the above medium which resulted in a culture composed entirely of spheroplasts (or protoplasts) and granules. Upon the withdrawal of penicillin these L-form cultures grew well and, after 100 passages, there was no reversion to the bacillary form. Sucrose could also be withdrawn from the medium. The effects of centrifugation, osmotic stabilizer, ultraviolet light, temperature, pH, and lyophilization upon stable L-forms were examined. L-forms were found to attach to the walls of culture tubes during trowth and sheets of L-form growth were obtained on cover slips in Leighton tubes and on the sides of medicine bottles.

9209|t|Isoelectric focusing of spectrin components in hereditary spherocytosis.
9209|a|1. By isoelectric focusing in 8 M urea, spectrin purified from normal human erythrocytes was resolved into 12 to 15 peptide bands differing by their isoelectric point. Most of them were focused between pH 6.4 and 5.2, one at pH 8.7 and some minor components between pH 7.4 and 6.8. 2. The results were not influenced by the erythrocyte population age. 3. Spectrin purified from erythrocytes of five patients with hereditary spherocytosis gave similar isoelectric focusing patterns, with the exception of the lack of the pH 8.7-focused component in two related patients.

9211|t|Determination of serum urea by mass fragmentography.
9211|a|A mass fragmentographic method of high accuracy for determination of serum urea is described. A fixed amount of [15N2]urea is added to a fixed amount of serum, then the urea is converted into 5,5-diallyl barbituric acid by coupling with diallyl malonic acid diethyl ester. The barbiturate is then transferred from an alkaline water phase into an organic phase containing methyl iodine by ion-pair extraction using tetrabutyl ammonium as the positive counterion. The amount of urea is determined from the ratio between the recordings at m/e 236 and m/e 238 obtained after analysis with a combined gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with an MID-unit (multiple-ion detector). The two ions used correspond to the molecular peak in the mass spectrum of the methyl derivative of unlabeled and labeled 5,5-diallyl barbituric acid, respectively. The relative standard deviation of the method was 3.6%. A comparison between the mass fragmentographic method and a routine method for determination of serum urea based on the urease-Berthelot reaction gave a high correlation (r = 0.99) and a regression coefficient of 0.95.

9217|t|Ultramicromethod for the determination of human arginase in the presence of urea.
9217|a|A technique for arginase determination in body fluids in the presence of urea is described. [14C]Arginine is hydrolysed by arginase to [14C]urea and ornithine. [14C]Urea is separated with paper chromatography and measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The experimental conditions including the pH, substrate concentration, activator, solvent for chromatography, urea inhibition, and arginase in hemolysates, are discussed.

9270|t|Antihistamines: pharmacology and clinical use.
9270|a|Antihistamines are a diverse group of drugs which possess the ability to inhibit various histaminic actions. By and large, they bear a certain structural resemblance to histamine, and act principally to prevent histamine-receptor interaction through competition with histamine for histamine receptors. Consequently, they are helpful therapeutically in preventing, rather than reversing, histaminic actions. Individual antihistaminic drugs act to inhibit histaminic action at one or another histamine receptor (H1 or H2-receptor), but not at both receptors. The large number of antihistaminics which have been available for many years and employed chiefly as 'antiallergic' drugs are classified as H1-receptor inhibitors; they are most effective therapeutically in inhibiting manifestations of histamine-induced wheal and erythema formation and pruritus. H2-receptor inhibitors, agents which are able to inhibit histamine-induced gastric acid secretion, have been developed more recently. Antihistaminics in general and H1-receptor inhibitors in particular, exert a wide variety of pharmacological activities. Their use is frequently accompanied by undesirable side-effects, notably CNS depression, dryness of mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal effects. Used judiciously and in proper dosage, antihistaminic drugs are helpful in the control of allergic disorders, allergic rhinitis and urticaria in particular; newly developed H2-receptor inhibitors show therapeutic promise in the treatment of peptic ulceration.

9295|t|Double-blind cross-over comparison of clenbuterol and salbutamol tablets in asthmatic out-patients.
9295|a|A double-blind cross-over comparison of a new beta2-sympathomimetic bronchodilator, clenbuterol, with salbutamol and placebo has been made during a 24 day period of out-patient treatment of 19 adults with moderately severe asthma. Oral clenbuterol (10 mug 3 times a day) and salbutamol (4 mg 3 times a day) were equally and significantly (p less than 0.001) more effective than placebo, when daily records of peak expiratory flow or use of isoprenaline inhalations were the criteria of activity. Daily records of symptoms according to a questionnaire also suggested relief of the subjective effects of asthma during treatment with both active drugs (p less than 0.01).

9332|t|gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase of rat intestine: localization and possible role in amino acid transport.
9332|a|gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT), an enzyme possibly involved in amino acid transport, was investigated in rat small intestine using the synthetic substrate L-gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. Enzyme localization and characteristics were correlated with features of amino acid uptake. gamma-GT activity copurified with sucrase and alkaline phosphatase. Activity was maximal at pH 8.2 and was stimulated by monovalent cations. The relative specificity of the gamma-GT reaction with diglycine and eight essential amino acids as substrates correlated well with the rate of intestinal absorption of this dipeptide and these amino acids as observed by others. gamma-GT activity was 12-fold greater in the jejunum than in the ileum, again in agreement with relative rates of amino acid absorption along the length of rat intestine. The specific activity of gamma-GT in villus tip cells was 10 times greater than in crypt cells, and amino acid uptake was 2 to 6 times greater with villus tip than with crypt cells. Bromosulfophthalein, a noncompetitive inhibitor of gamma-GT, inhibited amino acid uptake. These studies support the concept that membrane gamma-GT may be involved in amino acid and dipeptide uptake, and indicate that further investigation of such involvement may be conveniently pursued using mammalian small bowel.

9340|t|[Interaction of dl-mandelamidine (Olimidine) with some antihypertensive drugs expressed in the blood pressure of conscious rats].
9340|a|Hypotensive effect of dl-Mandelamidine (Olmidine, MA) in combination with some established antihypertensive drugs was studied in conscious normotensive rats. The mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured by means of a pressure transducer via a polyethylene tube inserted into the abdominal aorta of rat according to the method described by Weeks. The results obtained were as follows; 1) The hypotensive effects of guanethidine and hydrochlorothiazide were enhanced in combination with MA. 2) The hypotensive effect of reserpine was reduced by MA. 3) The hypotensive effects of clonidine, C6, propranolol and hydralazine were uneffected by MA. On the other hand, changes in heart rate induced by reserpine and C6 were increased by MA, however, those induced by guanethidine, clonidine propranolol and hydralazine were decreased by MA. The slight decrease in heart rate induced by hydrochlorothiazide was uneffected by MA. In view of our data, it is considered important that investigation of the interaction of antihypertensive drugs be done using conscious animals, as these drugs will be clinically prescribed.

9341|t|[Metabolic fate of carteolol hydrochloride (OPC-1085), a new beta-adrenergic agent. (3) Autoradiographic total body distribution studies in mice].
9341|a|Distribution of a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, 3H-carteolol in mice was studied by whole body autoradiography. The distribution of radioactivity was observed in all organs except the eyes and brain, with particularly high specific activities in the kidneys, liver, gall bladder and content in the intestines within a short time after either oral or intravenous administration. The radioactivity was then promptly eliminated from all tissues and organs, and excreted almost entirely in the urine and bile. Propranolol is known to be distributed at a high concentration in the brain, whereas the concentration of (3H-) carteolol detectable in the brain was slight. In the adrenal gland, the radioactivity was localized in the medulla. Radioactivity was detected also in the stomach contents after the intravenous administration. The distribution of radioactivity in the fetus through the placenta was less than that in the major organs of the mother mouse, and the elimination of the activity was more rapid in the fetus than in mother. These findings indicate that carteolol and its metabolites do to some extent pass through the blood-brain barrier and placenta.

9351|t|[Preparation and some properties of immobilized trypsin from the crayfish Cambarus affinis Say (author's transl)].
9351|a|The anionic tryptic enzyme from the crayfish (crayfish trypsin) was adsorbed to DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and covalently coupled to BrCN-activated Sepharose 4B and porous glass loaded with isothiocyanate propyl groups (ITC-glass). The relative activities against p-tosylarginine methyl ester (TosArgOMe) were found to be 30 to 100% for DEAE-Sephadex crayfish trypsin, 20 to 53% for Sepharose crayfish trypsin, and 17 to 38% for ITC-glass crayfish trypsin. The relative activities rise with declining protein content of the enzyme matrix complexes. The highest relative proteinase activities (substrate: 1% casein) were obtained with Sepharose crayfish trypsin (74%), followed by DEAE-Sephadex crayfish trypsin (68%) and ITC-glass crayfish trypsin (45%). Similar results are obtained with protamine and native lactate dehydrogenase as substrates. In accordance with the Sepharose bovine trypsin complex the apparent Michaelis constant (Km(app)) of the Sepharose crayfish trypsin with TosArgOMe was found to be markedly higher than that of the native enzyme. The pH-activity profiles of the crayfish trypsin derivatives using TosArgOMe as substrate were shown to be displaced towards more alkaline pH values by 0.5 (ITC-glass crayfish trypsin) and 1 (Sepharose crayfish trypsin) pH units, respectively, or towards more acidic pH values (by 1.5 pH units) with the polycationic derivative (DEAE-Sephadex crayfish trypsin) as compared to the native enzyme (optimum pH 8.6). Concerning the temperature stability of the derivatives, Sepharose crayfish trypsin was more stabile, ITC-glass crayfish trypsin behaves like the native crayfish trypsin, and DEAE-Sephadex crayfish trypsin was more sensitive at elevated temperatures as compared to the soluble enzyme. The properties of the crayfish trypsin derivatives are compared with the properties of the bovine analogues.

9389|t|Electron paramagnetic resonance of the tungsten derivative of rat liver sulfite oxidase.
9389|a|Sulfite oxidase purified from livers of tungsten-treated rats has been used for EPR studies of tungsten substituted at the molybdenum site of the enzyme in a fraction of the molecules. The EPR signal of W(V) in sulfite oxidase is quite similar to that of Mo(V) in its line shape and in its sensitivity to the presence of anions such as phosphate and fluoride. Hyperfine interaction with a dissociable proton is also observed in both signals. The pH-dependent alteration in line shape exhibited by the Mo(V) EPR signal of the rat liver enzyme. Incomplete reduction of the tungsten center at pH 9 is indicated by attenuated signal intensity at this pH. The W(V) signal has g values lower than those of the Mo(V) signal, has a much broader resonance envelope, and is much less readily saturated by increasing microwave power. Kinetic studies on the reduction of the heme and tungsten centers of sulfite oxidase have shown that reduction of de-molybdo forms of sulfite oxidase by sulfite is catalyzed by the residual traces of native molybdenum-containing molecules. Reduction is accomplished by electron transfer involving intermolecular heme-heme interaction. The W(V) signal is generated only after all the heme centers are reduced. The rate and extent of heme reduction at pH 9 are the same as at pH 7. Studies on the reoxidation of W(V) and reduced heme by O2 and by cytochrome c suggest that the cytochrome b5 of sulfite oxidase is the site of electron transfer to cytochrome c, whereas oxidase activity is the property of the molybdenum center. It appears that the tungsten center in sulfite oxidase is incapable of oxidizing sulfite.

9425|t|Metalloproteases of human articular cartilage that digest cartilage proteoglycan at neutral and acid pH.
9425|a|Extracts of human articular cartilage contain proteases capable of degrading the proteoglycan component of cartilage matrix at neutral and acid pH. These enzymes have been partially purified by ion exchange chromotography and characterized by disc electrophoresis, inhibition patterns, and action of proteoglycan. Three distinct metalloproteases are described. A neutral protease that digests proteoglycan subunit optimally at pH 7.25 has been purified up to 900-fold. It is strongly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, alpha-2-macroglobulin, and egg white, and to a lesser extent by D-penicillamine and EDTA. Inhibition by chelating agents is reversed by cobalt, zinc, and ferrous ions. Two acid metalloproteases, distinct from cathespins B1, D, and F, digest proteoglycan subunit at pH 4.5 and 5.5. Both are inhibited by o-phenanthroline and activity is restored by cobalt, zinc, or ferrous ions. With electron microscopy, it was found that cartilage slices were depleted of ruthenium red-staining matrix proteoglycan after incubation in vitro with a partially purified cartilage extract at neutral pH. Sedimentation, gel chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and immuno-diffusion studies of digests of isolated proteoglycan fraction produced by the partially purified cartilage extract at neutral and acid pH confirmed that the cartilage enzymes act only on the protein component of proteoglycan subunit, producing fragments with 5 to 12 chondroitin sulfate chains. The link proteins were not digested.

9509|t|Calcium-binding protein in bull seminal vesicle secretion and seminal plasma.
9509|a|A protein which showed high affinity for calcium ions was isolated from bull seminal vesicle secretion and seminal plasma. Its calcium-binding activity depended on the ionic strength and pH of the medium. The dissociation constant was 7-7 X 10(-7) M and there were 14 binding sites per protein molecule. The molecular weight of calcium-binding protein from bull seminal vesicle secretion, estimated by the gel filtration method, was 110,000. The protein may be involved in the regulation of the calcium ion level in seminal plasma.

9556|t|Studies on drug-induced lipidosis: VII. Effects of bis-beta-diethyl-aminoethylether of hexestrol, chloroquine, homochlorocyclizine, prenylamine, and diazacholesterol on the lipid composition of rat liver and kidney.
9556|a|4,4'-Bis (beta-diethylaminoethoxy)-alpha, beta-diethyldiphenylethane (DH), which had been shown to induce a type of lipidosis resembling Niemann-Pick disease, was given to rats at a dose of 20, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg body weight per day for 1 or 2 weeks. An enlargement of the liver with marked increases in free cholesterol, total phospholipids, and phosphatidylinositol took place by administration of a larger dose. The increase in bis (monoacylglyceryl) phosphate (BMGP), which is peculiar to this kind of drug-induced lipidosis, was dependent upon the dose of the drug as well as the length of time. Similar changes were also observed in kidney. Among several other drugs tested, chloroquine and diazacholesterol brought on as much increase in BMGP as treatment with DH.

9559|t|Role of the parietal cell in gastric damage induced by aspirin and related drugs: implications for safer therapy.
9559|a|The proton-secreting parietal cell is shown, from recent evidence, to be the principal focus for the actions of aspirin (and related drugs) in damaging the gastric mucosa. It is suggested that the selective damage to the parietal cells is due to the ph gradient favouring a high rate of aspirin uptake and subsequent entrapment of drug anions inside these cells. This concept may serve as a useful basis for developing procedures to minimize the gastric damage by aspirin and related acidic drugs.

9598|t|[Critical observations on changes in gamma-glutamyl-transpepdidase in hepatopathies].
9598|a|The behaviour of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was compared with other serum enzyme activities and functional parameters in a carefully selected and relatively extensive series of patients with liver disease, including alcoholics, in an investigation of the underlying pathogenesis and its clinical expression. Reference. to the literature and to personal data showed that increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels could be attributed to enzyme induction (caused by drugs or alcohol), liver damage in the broad sense, and intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. These causes were individually predominant, or nearly so, on occasions, though their concomitance was more common. High levels, however, were not pathognomonic for a given disease. In alcoholism, they were highly indicative, especially if accompanied by GLD changes. They were a virtually constant, early, and typical finding in intra- and extra-hepatic cholestasis, and tended to persist for a time after the resolution of icterus. Lastly, they were an aid in the early diagnosis of aggressive hepatitis and liver cancer.
