32926513|t|Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation for hydrogen peroxide production.
32926513|a|Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), as a green fuel and oxidant, has drawn increasing attention in the energy and environment field recently. Compared with the traditional anthraquinone process, electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis of H 2 O 2 , are cost-effective and environmental-friendly. In order to construct membrane-less EC/PEC devices for full H 2 O 2 synthesis, anodic H 2 O 2 production by water oxidation which is less developed compared with cathodic H 2 O 2 generation is highly desirable. Here, we reviewed recent developments for the EC/PEC H 2 O 2 production from water oxidation, including fundamental aspect, benchmarking activity evaluation, material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges and outlook of water oxidation for H 2 O 2 production, especially device-level development, accumulation and stability, and industrial applications. Our review is supposed to stimulate increasing extensive studies further improving the development of EC/PEC H 2 O 2 production.
